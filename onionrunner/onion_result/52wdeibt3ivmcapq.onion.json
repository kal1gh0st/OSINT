I do not intend to make this a big library (I want to stay under the radar).  If you liberated a paper and want to make it free for everybody, don't send it to me (you can't anyway coz you don't know who I am).  Learn how to set up a Tor hidden service instead and start your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSetting up a Tor service is really easy, just follow the directions at torproject.org.  You \u003cb\u003edon't\u003c/b\u003e need inbound connections on your router, Tor creates an outbound connection to the worldwide Tor network which is enough to be seen.  Kiss goodbye any dyndns stuff while you're at it, your home machine will be visible unter an address like foobar1234567890.onion forever.  If you restrict yourself to stuff that does not really need to be hidden, you can host your blog or whatever at home and give your friends the .onion URL.  Besides not needing dyndns services, you'll teach your friends to use Tor that way.  Theoretically you can even allow inbound SSH or VPN this way (I did not test that, I have already inbound VPN to another machine), and I want to keep this box as separate s possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\nExtra bonus: with an onion site, your reachability does not depend on the (few, slow, possibly hostile) exit nodes, only relay nodes (of which there are plenty with usually good throuput) are used.  The whole traffic between the users browser and your server is encrypted end-to-end, even with simple HTTP (i.e. kiss goodbye HTTPS as well, it's a PITA to install and maintain anyway).\n\n\u003ch2\u003eStuff\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe structure is trivial: Just a directory tree (which will change from time to time, and which you can ignore (the URLs of the files are in the ToC)).  Each paper/book has three files: \u003ci\u003ename\u003c/i\u003e.pdf or \u003ci\u003ename\u003c/i\u003e.djvu etc. is the real thing.  \u003ci\u003ename\u003c/i\u003e.bib is a bibtex file which you can use in your papers.  \u003ci\u003ename\u003c/i\u003e.bib.html is a HTML file which \u003cb\u003edisplays\u003c/b\u003e the bib-file in your browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe following table of contents is autogenerated by a cronjob walking the directory structure, generating entries using the BibTeX files.  If you see funny things like \u003cb\u003e\\\"{u}\u003c/b\u003e, that's why.  I'm not going to change that.  Some BibTeX files should be usable, but I used very long tags in order to avoid collisions.  Others look like bibtex, but contain fields that aren't regular, I made them up to describe videos, sound files etc.  You might change them to sonething shorter like \"Fry2012a\" if you cite them in your work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I find time, I'll add tags to the files and split the table of contents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"contents.html\"\u003eTable of contents\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eImportant hidden servers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"darknet.html\"\u003edarknet.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n","pageTitle":"Liberated Books and Papers","responseHeaders":{"ACCEPT-RANGES":"bytes","CONTENT-LENGTH":"2918","CONTENT-TYPE":"text/html","DATE":"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 06:17:27 GMT","ETAG":"\"b66-527f1fa5ccbea\"","LAST-MODIFIED":"Mon, 28 Dec 2015 09:32:04 GMT","SERVER":"Apache/2.4.20 (Unix) PHP/7.0.7"},"bitcoinAddresses":null,"sshKey":"","ftpFingerprint":"","ftpBanner":"","smtpFingerprint":"","smtpBanner":""}
