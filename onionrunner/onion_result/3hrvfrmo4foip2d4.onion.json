This adds an essential layer of anonymity to your online activity to protect you against 'Blockchain Analysis'.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFor discussion about this mixer, and making sure this is the correct url please go to this this forum thread on \u003ca href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=436467.0;all\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBitcointalk.org\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cb\u003e\u003cp\u003e1.

Best-Practice for Top-Level Anonymity\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e::: 1. Why Mix Your Coins :::\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eUsing Bitcoin does not protect your anonymity. This is because Bitcoin works on a public ledger, meaning anyone anywhere can see and follow every transaction you ever make. From the moment you buy your coins, to the moment you cash them out... they can be followed. And if anything along the way can be linked to your identity - for example if you bought or sold using your bank account, face to face with cash, or even using a voucher from a store with CCTV - then an agency with the right tools could theoretically find you without much trouble. Classic examples of people who might follow your online activity and reveal your identity, are Law Enforcement Agencies, somebody with a grudge, or hackers who have noticed you are moving large amounts of money around.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBut by 'mixing' your Bitcoins, you are essentially breaking the link between your identity and your transactions - Bitcoin Blender lets you prevent Blockchain Analysis by swapping your coins for somebody else's. In other words, you deposit your coins into one 'pot', and we send you coins from another 'pot', breaking the chain.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e::: 2. Why Bitcoin Blender? :::\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAt Bitcoin Blender, we have implemented a range of features that we believe make us one of the best, most effective Bitcoin mixing services available:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e- Low, Randomized Fees (1-3%)\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWhen you deposit coins into your Bitcoin Blender account, we will take a low, randomized fee of between 1-3%. We make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable, and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable. In other words, if our fee was a standard 2%, blockchain analysis would be made more trivial - interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a 2% modifier. Our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e- Bonus Program (0.5%)\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf you deposit more than 10 BTC within 7 days, your new deposits will give a bonus of 0.5% of the deposit, effectively making the fee 0.5% lower for you. We believe in showing our high volume users appreciation. We have structured this as a bonus rather than a fee rebate in order to maintain the integrity of the 1-3% randomized fee.\u003cbr\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e- Referral Program (0.5%)\u003cbr\u003e\r\nWe have designed a referral program to show our appreciation to our users who see Bitcoin Blender as a streamlined, fast, and most importantly effective mixer. Once combined deposits from a user and his/her referred users reaches 10BTC in 7 days, the referring user will be credited 0.5% of all deposits. A token of appreciation for helping improve Bitcoin Blender by bringing more transactions to the pool.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e- Two Factor Authentication with PGP\u003cbr\u003e\r\nBy setting your PGP key in your profile you will activate Two Factor Authentication, which means that you have to decrypt a message containing a randomized One Time Password on each login. This ensures that only the individual with access to your private key and password can access your account and your funds.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e- Up To 5 Simultaneous Deposit Addresses\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAs per coin-mixing best-practice (see part 4 below), splitting chunks of money between different wallets and addresses makes your anonymity even stronger. With Bitcoin Blender you can send your un-mixed coins to 5 different addresses at once - they will all show up as a single balance in your account for ease of withdrawal. You can then delete them and get new ones.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e- Auto-Withdrawal\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf you prefer, you can set wallet addresses for auto-withdrawal so you do not have to log back in to withdraw your coins. Withdraws are scheduled and with random delays for best anonymity. Set and forget. We take measures to ensure you only have to pass credentials as often as truly necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e- Fast Processing\u003cbr\u003e\r\nAlthough it is recommended that you let your coins 'sit' for a while (among other techniques - see part 4 below), Bitcoin Blender makes your coins instantly available for withdrawal the moment your deposits are confirmed. As is outlined below, your withdrawal comes from a totally different 'pool' of coins, so your withdrawn coins are never traceable from your deposited coins.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e::: 3. Other Methods :::\u003c/b\u003e\u003cp\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several ways of 'mixing' your coins, however many of these do not provide the same protection against Blockchain Analysis as Bitcoin Blender (and other similar hidden services).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\r\nPerhaps the most common method aside from using a hidden service mixer like Bitcoin Blender, is the Coin Join method found on services such as Shared Coin. The way this method works is by attaching your transaction to a number of other transactions, thereby making it difficult to tell which has gone where. And although this method does help maintain a certain degree of anonymity, it still provides a level of 'taint' for somebody experienced in Blockchain Analysis. 'Taint' can be seen as the trail your transaction leaves behind, and although techniques used by services like Shared Coin certainly blur that trail, they do not remove it completely - for best results, you should find a service that sends you coins from a completely different 'pot'.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e::: 4. Best-Practice for Top-Level Anonymity :::\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAs a standalone tool, Bitcoin Blender provides a very good level of anonymity for erasing your transaction trail. However, as with anything, you can always take extra precautions to ensure your anonymity remains top-notch and offers the greatest protection possible. As well as using Bitcoin Blender's basic features, we recommend the following:\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e1. Deposit to Multiple Addresses\u003cbr\u003e\r\nBitcoin Blender makes available the ability to split your deposit up between five bitcoin addresses at once. If an interested party is attempting to locate your deposit of 50BTC, their task is made exponentially more difficult because they must attempt to locate five deposits of varying amounts that may or may not add up to 50BTC.\r\n\u003cp\u003e2. Delay Your Withdrawals\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf someone is watching the blockchain, and they notice a transaction for 100 BTC at 4:30, followed by another transaction of 98 BTC at 5:00, they might suspect this is a part of the same trail - even if there is no hardcore evidence. By waiting several hours, days or even weeks, you are further distancing yourself from association with the coins you wish to mix.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e3. Withdraw to Multiple Addresses\u003cbr\u003e\r\nBy the same token, if you deposit 100btc and withdraw 98btc to a single address, this may give somebody watching the Blockchain reason to suspect it is part of the same trail. By making multiple withdrawals to different addresses generated by different wallets over a long period of time, you are further improving your anonymity. Bitcoin Blender makes this simple by allowing you to schedule your withdrawals for points in the future, so the task of mixing can be accomplished during a single session. As mentioned earlier, we take every measure possible to minimize the number of times a user must pass credentials in order to complete the task of mixing.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e4. Mix Multiple Times\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIf you want to really make your trail as difficult to follow as possible, and there is another service you trust you could mix your coins several times.\u003cp\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e5. Mix In, Mix Out\u003cbr\u003e\r\nYour 'buy in' and 'buy out' are the most vulnerable parts of your transaction trail, as they are the most likely points that you will be identified. If you do not wish your transactions to be followed, mix all coins you buy before you spend them, then mix anything you withdraw again on their way back out.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n        \u003c/div\u003e\r\n    \u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003cdiv id=\"footer\" content=\"footer\"\u003e\u003csmall\u003e\u003ca href=\"/bitcoinblender-public-key.txt\"\u003eBitcoin Blender PGP public key\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/div\u003e\r\n\u003c/html\u003e\r\n","pageTitle":"Bitcoin Blender, anonymous bitcoin mixer","responseHeaders":{"CACHE-CONTROL":"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0","CONNECTION":"keep-alive","CONTENT-TYPE":"text/html","DATE":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 04:07:35 GMT","EXPIRES":"Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT","PRAGMA":"no-cache","SERVER":"Apache","SET-COOKIE":"PHPSESSID=l3mr7g0c3n3047hkk5mlq8hc72; path=/","VARY":"Accept-Encoding","X-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS":"nosniff"},"bitcoinAddresses":null,"sshKey":"","ftpFingerprint":"","ftpBanner":"","smtpFingerprint":"","smtpBanner":""}
