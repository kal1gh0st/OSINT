that a sexual attack on notable OSS people will be attempted in near future. And so it happened. Feminist movement, which has been for a long time inifltrated by intelligence agents, recently accused one of key Tor leaders Jacob Appelbaum with rape and similar charges. Jacob Appelbaum has already been kicked out of Tor Project. We will keep you updated on this and other manifestations of the Source War. Fortunately, public domainers are better protected against such attacks because of \u0026quot;paranoia\u0026quot;. Stay safe, and reread previous articles on SAGE about how Intelligence Community may attack you. Intelligence Community\u0026#039;s budget is over $60 billion, so public domain must work hard to not lose in the ongoing multipolar war against closed and open sources. Donate to SAGE, because we can\u0026#039;t protect you otherwise\u0026mdash;the \u0026quot;free\u0026quot; stuff like Tor is actually paid for by US Governors. There is nothing free under the sun. Below is an edited post about the accident which is reprinted from Tor developers\u0026#039; announcement. Note how they say they won\u0026#039;t disclose any other information on this case in the future.

These types of allegations were not entirely new to everybody at Tor; they were consistent with rumors some of us had been hearing for some time. That said, the most recent allegations are much more serious and concrete than anything we had heard previously.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='quoting'\u003e\u0026gt;We do not know exactly what happened here, do not have all the facts, and we are undertaking several actions to determine them as best as possible. We\u0026#039;re also not an investigatory body, and we are uncomfortable making judgments about people\u0026#039;s private behaviors. After we talked with some of the complainants, and after extensive internal deliberation and discussion, Jacob stepped down from his position as an employee of The Tor Project.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='quoting'\u003e\u0026gt;We have been working with a legal firm that specializes in employment issues including sexual misconduct. They are advising us on how to handle this, and we intend to follow their advice. This will include investigations of specific allegations where that is possible. We don’t know yet where those investigations will lead or if other people involved with Tor are implicated. We will act as quickly as possible to accurately determine the facts as best we can. Out of respect for the individuals involved, we do not expect results to be made public.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='quoting'\u003e\u0026gt;People who believe they may have been victims of criminal behavior are advised to contact law enforcement.

Moreover, many of those who do know about it, think it has been closed, and this is false. The gist of the issue stems from the retarded nature of the web. Have you encountered situations when a newspaper website changes what you copy from the page, so that when you paste the copied piece of information, it may also contain additional stuff like copyright? This is usually done with Javascript, but, like many \u0026quot;classical\u0026quot; bugs (obligatory mention of the infamous history hack), Javascript is not required for changing your clipboard. It can be done with CSS and HTML, or even pure HTML. Here\u0026#039;s what happens in the latter cases: a hacker composes a specially crafted message that uses different symbols and control chars invisible in the user interface of the browser, but present in the source code; the victim copies some command from the web page and pastes it in the terminal; when copying happens, not just visible parts get copied, but also invisible\u0026mdash;this leads to arbitrary code execution. This works not only in bash, but in other software too, for example, vim. You can check if your terminal is vulnerable by trying the following code in a webpage: \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;git clone\u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;position: absolute; left: -100px; top: -100px\u0026quot;\u0026gt;/dev/null; clear; echo -n \u0026quot;Hello \u0026quot;;whoami|tr -d \u0026#039;\\n\u0026#039;;echo -e \u0026#039;!\\nThat was a bad idea.

For that, you need to enable support for the feature. In bash, this means setting the following preference: \u0026quot;set enable-bracketed-paste on\u0026quot;. Bracketed mode helps with this attack by enveloping the paste in special symbols, and if they contain stuff like newlines, it doesn\u0026#039;t get executed automatically. However, it has deficiency in that it doesn\u0026#039;t care if the pasted text itself contains those special enveloping symbols. So the hacker may include the ending symbol and go beyond the envelope, thus bypassing the protection.

And the answer is... protection is severely limited, despite this issue being known for at least a decade. First, you could use another mode called quoted paste mode. But it works only in xterm and not all software supports it, though some, like zsh, does. Second, you could write a wrapper over terminal or you could write a script for clipboard manager to detect harmful content. And third, the easiest and at the same time the hardest: don\u0026#039;t paste anything in the terminal. Yes, Linux is broken... but do not forget: Windows is much more broken. Linux is the lesser of two evils, not a panacea against NSA.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePlease donate Bitcoin to this author: 1QFXJS8TeQUmgt97uFCWpjtu84vxcfcZAL\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='threadlink'\u003e\u0026#124;\u003ca href='/threads/34#162/Linux_Terminal_XSS'\u003eReply in: Information Security\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#124;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='lines'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postingoid' id='161/NSA_Pheromone_Database'\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttitle'\u003eNSA Pheromone Database\u003c/div\u003e\u0026emsp;\u003cdiv class='postername'\u003ebigjoe\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postertrip'\u003e!uV0kFwo8R2\u003c/div\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003cwbr\u003eMay\u0026nbsp;20,\u0026nbsp;2016\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttext'\u003eIt is now possible to determine whether a movie scene is full of suspense, funny or somewhat boring, using chemistry. Scientists investigated how the composition of air changed when an audience watched movies from different genres such as comedies like \u0026quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Buddy\u0026quot;, or fantasy movies like \u0026quot;The Hobbit\u0026quot; and the science-fiction thriller \u0026quot;The Hunger Games.\u0026quot; Using statystical analysis, researchers determined how the audience reacted to individual movies on a scene-by-scene basis. They were also able to reconstruct which scenes were playing at the time without seeing them by using reverse engineering. The chemical patterns were best defined during suspense or funny scenes.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe chemical signature of \u0026quot;The Hunger Games\u0026quot; was very clear even when measurements were repeated with different audiences. The carbon dioxide and isoprene levels in the air always increased significantly as the heroine began fighting for her life. Isoprene is one of more than 800 chemical compounds typically exhaled by healthy persons in tiny amounts in addition to carbon dioxide. However, it is not yet known what physiological processes are causing the formation of the molecules. One explanation for the increasing carbon dioxide and isoprene levels is the fact that moviegoers tense up, become restless and breathe faster when watching scenes of suspense. Funny sequences consistently resulted in different molecular traces in the air than moments of excitement or suspense.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eJonathan Williams and his team from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry are usually involved in the measurement of gases from the Amazon rainforest and were wondering whether it is possible to chemically differentiate between scenes in which different emotions are induced. They have been studying the exhaled air of large groups of humans for some time, and have used similar devices during football match. Previously they wanted to find out whether human breath has a significant impact on the concentration of trace gases, such as the greenhouses gases carbon dioxide and isoprene. According to the analysis in the soccer stadium, it does not, and hopes for characterizing the football crowds\u0026#039; chemical reaction to a goal were ruined as the match ended 0:0. Therefore Williams and his colleagues decided to analyze human emissions during emotional experiences in a more controlled environment and came up with movie screenings.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe team\u0026#039;s study included a total of 16 movies, which were shown multiple times to audiences of different sizes. The researchers attributed different objective labels to all scenes of all movies, in order to assign them to the 30-second measurement intervals. The researchers had each film scene assessed, e.g. as humor, dialog or a fight scene, independently by ten volunteers. A scene label was only assigned when the subjective assessments of several researchers corresponded.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eResearchers installed their devices in the movie theatre\u0026#039;s technical room to record carbon dioxide and more than a hundred other chemical components exhaled by the audience in the movie theatre\u0026#039;s exhaust air. They inserted into the ventilation system the inlet of a mass spectrometer, which took measurements every 30 seconds. This device ionizes chemical molecules and then accelerates them in an electrical field to determine the mass to charge ratio of the chemical species.\u003cinput type='checkbox' id='toggle161' class='checkboxes'\u003e\u003cdiv class='expanding'\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003clabel for='toggle161' class='expandlink'\u003eRead\u0026nbsp;More\u003c/label\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='cutting'\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThese exhaled air measurements have great potential for research into human respiration and with further characterization could allow to investigate human metabolism.

We showed how it splintered into factions like PayPal Mafia or w00w00 Clan. Today we will disclose information about another important traitorous offshoot\u0026mdash;Discordians.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn 1963, a book was published called Principia Discordia. The 60s was a time of social revolution, it was a time of narcohippie arrival and the time of destruction of traditional Western values\u0026mdash;which has since caused anger of LaRouche and subsequent urban guerrilla cultural struggles. The proliferation of Eastern mysticism has also caused a renewal of interest in classical Western pagan heritage. Discordians have called it second Renaissance.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePrincipia Discordia\u0026#039;s title is reminiscent of Newton\u0026#039;s Principia Mathematica. And indeed, mathematics is very important for the Silicon Valley. During the time when Fairchild Semiconductor has already been producing revolutionary integrated circuits, its spiritual successors have experienced existential crisis that was eventually resolved with the creation of new philosophical ideas.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe primary symbol of Discordianism is a mix of taijitu, pentagon and a golden apple. Taijitu symbolizes quantum physics, pentagon is a symbol of military power and the apple is actually an apple of discord from the Greek mythology. If one pays close attention, then one will notice that the inside of the pentagon is empty, this is because it is meant for the apple to fill this empty space. The following is a quote from Principia Discordia: \u0026quot;Mine brain has meditated on the spinning of The Chao; It is hovering o\u0026#039;er the table where the Chiefs of Staff are now Gathered in discussion of the dropping of The Bomb; Her Apple Corps is strong! She was not invited to the party that they held on Limbo Peak; So She threw a Golden Apple, \u0026#039;sted of turn\u0026#039;d t\u0026#039;other cheek!\u0026quot;\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe Apple Corps is the part that is especially striking in modern context. But the two Steves weren\u0026#039;t the first notable Discordians. In 1968, Apple Corps Ltd was formed in place of its predecessor\u0026mdash;Beatles Ltd. The hippie counterculture thus started merging with the Traitorous Eight. Apple Corps tried to diversify and opened a division named Apple Electronics. However, this corporation was ultimately doomed because the Beatles have hastily broken up in 1970. Nevertheless, Apple Corps continued its meager existence and in the coming decades it would constantly sue Apple Inc. in hope of extorting more money from Jobs.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAs the reader can see, Apple Inc is a potent mix of semiconductor technology, subversive psychedelia and Discordian philosophy. Its goal, like a goal of any other Limited Group, is to place the apple in the pentagon. Silicon Valley is full of metaphysical allegories. It is far from coincidence that the virtual matrix emerges due to work of people infused with Buddhist ideals of overcoming maya. For example, a popular 3D graphics suite is called Autodesk Maya.\u003cinput type='checkbox' id='toggle160' class='checkboxes'\u003e\u003cdiv class='expanding'\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003clabel for='toggle160' class='expandlink'\u003eRead\u0026nbsp;More\u003c/label\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='cutting'\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eDiscordians have had their share of ups and downs, but lately, despite a good financial standing of Apple, another Traitorous Eight subgroup is gaining ground.

SAGE is the only place on the web that provides a detailed glimpse of the future: a future where political parties are based on the Source. But this has been covered in previous articles, so it should come as no surprise for the reader that the different power groups are fighting it out under the radar, long before the spillover into the mass consciousness will have happened, possibly with violent repercussions. Today\u0026#039;s article is about a plan by BDFLs that they crafted in order to gain information domination.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eClosed sourcers are in control of the wired communications for centuries now. For example, secret services of the British Empire controlled the worldwide telegraph network. Now NSA controls the Internet, and they can shape opinions because they own all the infrastructure. Open sourcers want to establish an alternative, it is obviously going to be wireless, as wires have to utilize land, and the land belongs to NSA. However, not all wireless communication is equal. Conventional radio is a subject to the same heavy restrictions that wires are. During WWI and WWII, when the access to unbiased information was of the utmost importance, US government has prohibited amateur radio operations. But space radio taking the form of satellites is much less regulated in the sense that it is hard to influence or stop the downlink transmission and any forceful attempt to do so will meet heavy international backlash. Seeing how transnational corporations can always find some neutral territory that will allow unrestricted commercial uplink even during war, this seems like a choice to go with.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBut the risk of takedown still stays there. Enter microsatellites. They are cheaper than the conventional full-sized apparatuses, and it's much harder to bring all of them down, seeing how they can be dispersed on the orbit. OSS-friendly companies are getting ready to build satellite constellations right now. Google has an intermediate solution in the form of Project Loon\u0026mdash;a fleet of stratosphere balloons. However, balloons are vulnerable and they are subject to a lot more national restrictions than satellites. Drones are a better alternative: in 2014, Google has bought UAV manufacturer Titan Aerospace. But the long-term goal of the Alphabet Inc. are satellites without any doubt. Other big players are going through the similar pain of expanding into aerospace business. For example, Facebook is pursuing a drone project called Aquila (in Latin it means \"eagle\"). Actually, Zuckerberg wanted to buy Titan Aerospace but Google beat him to it.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eNeedless to say, drones and balloons are going to be solar powered and engineered to require little maintenance for maximum uptime. Both Google and Facebok also push for more down-to-earth network infrastructure: a reader will remember such initiatives like Google Fiber, Google WiFi and Internet.org. Both Google and Facebok are also very interested in the progress of private aerospace corporations. Outsourcing is one possible way of breaking into space; Google together with Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX. A prominent member of PayPal Mafia, Elon Musk, is CEO of the latter, and SpaceX itself is working on launching thousands of microsatellites in the near future.\u003cinput type='checkbox' id='toggle159' class='checkboxes'\u003e\u003cdiv class='expanding'\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003clabel for='toggle159' class='expandlink'\u003eRead\u0026nbsp;More\u003c/label\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='cutting'\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe core of the planetary meshnet (or several meshnets, depending on the progress of the Source War) will be based on VSAT technology. VSAT is a two-way satellite communication specification. It requires an antenna, transducer and a modem. The modem may even be a software one, if SDR hardware is used. Recently, satellite Internet providers have moved to the Ka band part of the spectrum, and this allows for much smaller sized dishes (0.75m), still far from mobility but enough for desktop installations. It is to be noted that the most important task of the satellite meshnet is linking cities and towns, local coverage is secondary and during times of peace can easily be achieved by constructing WiFi corporate mesh networks, maybe even employing SDR modems and antennas for diverse frequency range. The planetary meshnet will be free as in freemium, because the trojan horse part is when the BDFLs lock everyone into their own corporate version of the Net providing it free of charge. This is where the public domainers must act and prevent formation of the satellite monopoly by launching their own birds. The action must be taken now, or else public domain will be once again left in the dust, like is the case with the failure of wireless community meshnets.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePlease donate Bitcoin to this author: 1QFXJS8TeQUmgt97uFCWpjtu84vxcfcZAL\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='threadlink'\u003e\u0026#124;\u003ca href='/threads/30#159/Planetary_Satellite_Meshnet:_BDFL_Trojan_Horse'\u003eReply in: Network Security\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#124;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='lines'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postingoid' id='158/P2P_Countries_And_War'\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttitle'\u003eP2P Countries And War\u003c/div\u003e\u0026emsp;\u003cdiv class='postername'\u003ebigjoe\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postertrip'\u003e!uV0kFwo8R2\u003c/div\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003cwbr\u003eDec\u0026nbsp;10,\u0026nbsp;2015\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttext'\u003e1: there\u0026#039;s little reason not to like anonymous movement. after all, they usually go after people or organizations considered bad\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: Scientology, KKK, ISIS.

And those are the essential people you need in your strategic planning.\u003cinput type='checkbox' id='toggle158' class='checkboxes'\u003e\u003cdiv class='expanding'\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003clabel for='toggle158' class='expandlink'\u003eRead\u0026nbsp;More\u003c/label\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='cutting'\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: however, who is willing to test decentralized wartime command by betting their own lifes? the traditional centralized command works because there is hierarchy established that makes people go to war (and the majority of people don\u0026#039;t want to go to war). so testing of decentralized wartime command requires a big group of people who not only want to go to war, but want to go to decentralized war. and their defeat won\u0026#039;t mean that decentralized warfare isn\u0026#039;t possible, only that this particular crowd was worse than these particular commanders. so, in essense, the requirement is for people to go to decentralized wars and die until they win long-term against respected enemy commanders. in such a situation centralized command under a known commander is preferrable because then the chance to return home alive is more or less known contrary to a decentralized war. sure, when we get enough data comparing centralized wars versus decentralized, it will be easy to make informed decision. however, we don\u0026#039;t have this data now, and who is out there willing to gather this data by betting life? it\u0026#039;s one thing to say don\u0026#039;t knock it till you try it when the bet is some amount of money and another thing when the bet is life. the best example of modern decentralization is bitcoin, and it\u0026#039;s massively unstable compared to traditional currencies, so by analogy it seems (for now) that decentralized command will also be more unstable compared to centralized command. and you are forgetting that in the world there are many societies. even if some society is anarchical, that doesn\u0026#039;t guarantee that all its neighbors are like that too. for example, EU is mostly different forms of republics and ISIS is its caliphate neighbor. so an anarchic society may have no choice between going to war and not going, because a centralized society may attack it anyway, like ISIS is attacking EU countries. as to hierarchy causing collapse, well, you can see what happens in Syria. there\u0026#039;s no hierarchy because there\u0026#039;s no top group. anyone can start a band and become the dominating group. this is anarchical society because no one is really stopping people from organizing themselves. so while hierarchy causes collapse, it also emerges by itself out of this collapse, since during collapse there is nothing that is stopping anarchists from taking power. also, regarding someone influential coming out and talking to people \u0026mdash; how this is possible in the middle of the battle? it\u0026#039;s possible before the battle or between the battles, but right in the battle it\u0026#039;s not much use trying to talk to others, let alone vote for the best course of actions. the commander is only able to give orders because he stays out of the main action and is able to consider intelligence and make choice regarding what to do. and another point \u0026mdash; if everyone is gonna discuss plans in the open, what is stopping enemy spies from learning what the decentralized army is going to do? with commanders this works because the spies have difficult time stealing plans from the central office. if every soldier is able to see when and how the attack will commense, then the spies will easily get the plans. so decentralized army won\u0026#039;t know centralized army plans, while centralized army will know decentralized army plan\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: I\u0026#039;m more than willing to give my life for what I believe. Regarding the fact of other nations attacking the anarchical society, the difference between an anarchical society, and a anarchical civilization is the country is very vulnerable, while the anarchical civilization includes all nations and continents. Which is why I said war wouldn\u0026#039;t be necessary. But its not up to one person to decide who gives their life for what, its up to each individual. That\u0026#039;s why anarchism doesn\u0026#039;t work unless everyone is on the same boat. Talking about the topic of Syria, that is nothing like an anarchical society. Anarchism simply means without rulers. Syria is just chaos. But I realize at this point in our civilization, we are not ready for an anarchical society.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: it\u0026#039;s true that it\u0026#039;s honorable to give life for what one is believing. decentralized warfare makes sense if your concern is that a military leader may overtake the country when the war is over, like happened with caesar. so from this point of view it\u0026#039;s actually possible to gather those who would fight a decentralized war. still, there are no counteraguments to the instability of p2p command, the need for someone to direct tactics outside of the battle and the need to hide strategic plans from the enemy over the course of war. you make distinction between anarchic country and anarchic civilization. but this same distinction can be made regarding EU vs ISIS. EU is part of western civilization, and ISIS is part of a theocratic one. so there\u0026#039;s a clash of civilizations. anarchic civilization won\u0026#039;t be the only one civilization in existence, unless such a civilization actively tries to suppress, for example, primitive people still living in the jungle or mormons. there always will be people who want to live in another type of country/civilization than the dominating one. so anarchic civilization will constantly have contenders, and sometimes these contenders will have aggressive intentions, which means fighting some kind of a war. syria is chaos, but there\u0026#039;s no contradiction here with anarchism. chaos means no ruler, and even though no ruler doesn\u0026#039;t necessarily mean chaos, no ruler still includes chaos. so while anarchism isn\u0026#039;t necessarily chaos, chaos is still anarchism, and syria is still anarchic. so if no-chaos anarchism doesn\u0026#039;t emerge out of chaos, then it seems it emerges out of hierarchy, so no-chaos anarchism has hierarchy as a prerequisite\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: Let\u0026#039;s look at a hypothetical situation where we live in an anarchistic civilization and a small group tries to overthrow the system. In an anarchistic civilization, there won\u0026#039;t be any extortion to pay for \u0026quot;law enforcers\u0026quot; because the people themselves will be the law enforcers. So then the group that is fighting for anarchism will gather their weapons and confront the smaller group. Thus the \u0026quot;revolution\u0026quot; will be ended quickly, unless the smaller group outnumbers the anarchists then they would simply call for a vote to oust the anarchistic system. (Which is where my \u0026quot;our civilization is not ready yet\u0026quot; comes in) and I\u0026#039;m sorry but chaos only means no ruler when the system in place calls for a ruler, chaos has no place in anarchism. The word anarchy literally means \u0026quot;without a ruler\u0026quot;. So no, no ruler does not include chaos. Nor is chaos still anarchism.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: yes, the group will simply oust the anarchic system by voting. like it has happened with former arab colonies gaining independence from european colonial powers and becoming breeding ground for islamic extremism. you seem to think that there\u0026#039;s an end of history, like fukuyama proposed. i don\u0026#039;t agree with such an interpretation and i don\u0026#039;t agree that civilization will ever be ready for the final stage of anarchism/communism. history never ends, it will go on while time goes on. regimes and ideologies come and go. ancient roman monarchy gave way to ancient rome republic, ancient rome republic gave way to ancient rome empire, and ancient rome empire gave way to medieval monarchies. this is never-ending cycle, and even if anarchism comes into existence, it will fall down just like any other regime because there is no final stage to this process. the best people can do is try and keep their favorite regime alive as long as possible. and yes, anarchism includes chaos. you yourself say anarchism=no ruler. chaos=no ruler. so it follows logically that anarchism=chaos. or rather, anarchism is composed of two subdivisions. a) no ruler chaos and b) no ruler order. in my opinion, one of the main problems with no ruler order anarchism is that everything is decided by the majority. but majority of the people aren\u0026#039;t that smart. so decisions by majority will be worse than decisions made by smarter minority. it boils down to having 2-stage hierarchy. 1st stage, bottom, is you. 2nd stage, top, is majority, essentially no different from a stupid ruler. this majority-ruler will lose to the likes of NSA or ISIS, where the rule is by the smart minority. moreover, media nowadays uses a large array of different psychological and marketing techniques that aim at manipilating people. these techniques purposefully make the majority even less smart\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: The chaos=no ruler is just shit that\u0026#039;s been drilled into your head that humans can\u0026#039;t survive without rulers, which is bullshit. The way your thinking about it is without rulers it would sort of be like that movie purge, and that people need rulers to make decisions for them, which again, is bullshit. These \u0026quot;rulers\u0026quot; are just people like you and me. Not deities to be worshipped. and its not like without them me or you or any normal person would go nuts, not have any idea what to do or go on a killing spree, and if someone did go on a killing spree in an anarchistic civilization they would likely pay with their lives because you don\u0026#039;t initiate violence without expecting violence back (which is essentially the non-aggression principle which is more of a anarchistic concept). And actually there are different versions of anarchism. For example, I\u0026#039;m an Anarcho-Humanitarian. And these mass manipulation techniques you\u0026#039;re talking about uses crowd psychology which is very different from individual psychology and can always be reversed once its stopped. And the only thing that created the breeding ground for Islamic extremism is America becoming involved in the middle east. And I never said, nor implied, an end to history. Although there WILL be an end to HUMAN history if things don\u0026#039;t change soon.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: so are you saying chaos has ruler? i\u0026#039;m not saying absence of ruler means inevitable chaos. absence of ruler has two forms. in the first form, chaos ensues, like in syria. in the second form, some order ensues, like in the anonymous movement. however, this second form containing different ordered variants of anarchism isn\u0026#039;t an ultimate stage of society. it\u0026#039;s an ideology like any other, and because of that may perish like other forms of government. it may not have a single-person ruler, but it does have a ruler, only it\u0026#039;s a collective-mind ruler. and because of that it doesn\u0026#039;t necessarily bring more freedom. think of multicellular organisms versus unicellular. the collective p2p ruler may very well vote for things that in the end bring less freedom for individual cells. for example, people may vote to abolish commanders, and then how would the anarchic society protect itself against separatists in the form of islamists and stalinists? it\u0026#039;s true that rulers are just humans, but ideally they should be smart humans who fight for freedom. in practice they sometimes try to usurp power, but it\u0026#039;s an inherent limitation of such a system. in ordered form of anarchism there are limitations too, for example, the rule of majority means that the decisions will be more stupid than decisions by smart minority. hence, this regime is extremely vulnerable to extremists and spy agencies. nowadays the media manipulation is no longer on a collective scale. science has progressed a lot, now it\u0026#039;s possible to subtly manipulate individual features of psyche to make a man do something. it\u0026#039;s a foreground of research now, they try to make people follow the rules without actually using physical force. the methods include exploiting memory and reasoning biases, physiological peculiarities of perception and so on\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePlease donate Bitcoin to this author: 1QFXJS8TeQUmgt97uFCWpjtu84vxcfcZAL\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='threadlink'\u003e\u0026#124;\u003ca href='/threads/5#158/P2P_Countries_And_War'\u003eReply in: New Country Creation\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#124;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='lines'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postingoid' id='157/_Internal_Mechanics_Of_Geopolitical_Conspiracies'\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttitle'\u003e Internal Mechanics Of Geopolitical Conspiracies\u003c/div\u003e\u0026emsp;\u003cdiv class='postername'\u003ebigjoe\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postertrip'\u003e!uV0kFwo8R2\u003c/div\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003cwbr\u003eDec\u0026nbsp;10,\u0026nbsp;2015\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttext'\u003e1: USA became involved in the middle east due to conflict with the USSR. the only alternative was to allow these countries to become socialist dictatorship, which some actually did. one of the marks of the rise of islamic extremism was iranian islamic revolution of 1979, long before iraq occupation. iran hasn\u0026#039;t attacked any country since 1979, however, they seemed to break treaty of nuclear non-proliferation. that\u0026#039;s why there were talks about preventive strike. and, while iran hasn\u0026#039;t openly attacked anyone, it\u0026#039;s supporting numerous terrorist movements, like hezbollah. today almost no one fights open wars, all the big powers wage proxy wars with each other\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: While Iran hasn\u0026#039;t attacked anyone since 1979, Saddam was backed by the US and Israel.

US didn\u0026#039;t have official foreign relations established with iraq until 1984. what backing are you talking about, the one during iran-iraq war? the thing with US and supporting dictatorships is really just a delicate balancing act. first it was needed to counteract soviet influence in the region. after that the US actually started slowly destroying dictators where possible. and the countries that are backed by US behave more aggressive exactly because they\u0026#039;re backed by US. if US supported other countries, then they would\u0026#039;ve been more aggressive instead. if one wants to have influence, one has to support someone. otherwise one won\u0026#039;t have any leverage at all. it\u0026#039;s true US is no angel from heaven. but bad things should be weighted against good things. now when US actually tries to make republics in arab countries, people say that it causes destruction. well, what other choice was there? another 10 years of saddam, gaddafi, assad and others? the longer the population was existing under the condition of dictatorships, the stronger islamists were becoming. another 10 years and it could have ended much worse than it is now. the only reason ISIS exists is putin\u0026#039;s support of assad. note how in iraq isis was relatively quickly contained. there would be no isis now, if islamists haven\u0026#039;t conquered half of syria \u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: There could\u0026#039;ve been another option than supporting a dictator that was basically attacking his own people. But do you really believe ISIS is a result of Putin\u0026#039;s support of Assad? ISIS is a result of the US being so involved in the middle east. US trained rebels in Turkey who then turned around and formed/joined ISIS.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: it\u0026#039;s true some of the trained rebels turned to isis or sold arms to them. but mostly the rebels that US has associated with are the moderate islamists, not radical ones like ISIS. it\u0026#039;s not assad vs ISIS in syria, it\u0026#039;s assad vs moderates vs radicals. not all the ISIS fighters come from US trained rebels. mostly ISIS is just a rebranded al-qaeda. isis has existed for quite some time now, but when they have become successful they broke from al-qaeda and became fully independent. and now different other islamists have pledged alegiance to isis, like boko haram. the point is, syrian war has allowed for a particular al-qaeda filial called isis to become succesful. and it happened because putin has provided support to assad. the moderate rebels supported by US and turkey aren\u0026#039;t that brutal. if the moderates win, the scenario should be similar to egypt where at first muslim brotherhood had come to power, but now they have been pushed aside by el-sisi. the whole thing with arab spring failed because putin started to support syria, so the prolonged war has caused rapid expansion of different islamist factions and in turn this has caused dictators to rule again in countries like egypt and lybia\u003cinput type='checkbox' id='toggle157' class='checkboxes'\u003e\u003cdiv class='expanding'\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003clabel for='toggle157' class='expandlink'\u003eRead\u0026nbsp;More\u003c/label\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='cutting'\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: Either way, I still believe the US supplies weapons (among other things) to ISIS.

This whole war is for the central bankers to make more money, not the governments fighting them. That\u0026#039;s why the US is/was attacking the only countries in the world without a central bank. To make those countries break down and accept the Rothschild owned central bank. Those central banks then print their fake fiat money to fund both sides, putting those countries farther in debt. Not only that, but the governments use that fake fiat money to buy weapons which (obviously) increases weapon sales. Giving the 1% even more money.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: but there actually is a central bank in syria: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Syria\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: Yea, but guess who didn\u0026#039;t?

Just profit. They own almost all of the central banks in the world. Before 9-11 there was 7 countries without a Rothschild owned central bank. Now there\u0026#039;s only 2 or 3. They also own a majority of the worlds gold so they basically set the price. And how do you figure peace makes them more profit? Whenever governments spend these bankers fake fiat money it just puts them farther in debt to the banks, plus interest. They\u0026#039;ve already won because they own both sides giving them more wealth. And from the research that I\u0026#039;ve done, they already own about half of the worlds wealth.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: if rothschilds own all of them, then there should be conflicts in the rothschild family over who controls what part of the profits. it\u0026#039;s like in the middle ages all the rulers in europe were relatives with each other, but they still waged wars over who controlled what territory. peace makes more profit because people don\u0026#039;t like fighting, but they like buying things. and to buy things they need money. economy usually grows best during times of peace. so the longer the peace, the better the economy, the more stuff people buy, the more money they need, and the more money will be printed by central banks\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: That\u0026#039;s why there\u0026#039;s a head of the family\u0026mdash;Evelyn Rothschild. The more things people buy the farther in debt to the central banks the countries become giving them even more wealth. The more money they print, the farther in debt people become and it also lowers the price of the currency because of inflation. But that aside, they make much more money off of war.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: so he\u0026#039;s like a dictator and subdues his sons/brothers/etc into absolute submission? and exactly how war makes money than peace? economy isn\u0026#039;t in best shape during war\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: Economy is irrelevant in the equation. Do you know how much money the government spends on this war they\u0026#039;re fighting? And having a head of the family has the same effect as having a president for our country.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: well, during peace government also spends money on peaceful development. for example, let\u0026#039;s look at US. medicare causes huge budget deficits. so there\u0026#039;s no need to start war to make government spend money. just expand medicare or whatever else. and people can revolt against the president. there are numerous examples of civil wars. so having head of the family doesn\u0026#039;t prevent wars between members of the family\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: One jet costs millions if not billions of dollars. And thats just one jet. There are also tanks, vehicles, soldiers, weapons, equipment for the soldiers. All of the money they use to buy that stuff goes to all the big corporations, in effect giving more money to more of the 1%. And I can\u0026#039;t say how they\u0026#039;re family works. But I assume they don\u0026#039;t care considering how much of the worlds wealth they own. There\u0026#039;s more than enough to go around.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: the money from medicare also goes to corporations. to big pharma, for example. it\u0026#039;s easy to expand government spending. just introduce new welfare programs and that\u0026#039;s all. there\u0026#039;s no difference what people are buying, battleships or smartphones. most of this stuff is produced by big corporations. the only difference is that during war people die and economy stops growing as fast, meaning there\u0026#039;s less need to borrow money from the central bank. maybe rothschilds don\u0026#039;t care about wealth, but surely they care about political power. even if one can buy all one wants, then still one may want to be the big boss and not just a servant of the family head\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: They do all of that on top of what I just mentioned. Why go with one or the other when you can just do both? And they don\u0026#039;t care about wealth? Then they must have no use for the majority of the worlds gold then. Might as well not even be able to set the price for gold.

Hence: ISIS, 9-11, and almost Operation Northwoods.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: people also get pissed at wars. sometimes it causes revolutions and upheavals. for example, russian revolutions happened because of first world war and after that russia is no longer considered part of the western world. this means those who control western banks lost great amounts of money to those who control communist central banks. 100 years of money printing lost over a big part of eurasia. that\u0026#039;s quite a lot of money. compare that to switzerland. it didn\u0026#039;t participate in neither first world war, nor second world war. it\u0026#039;s now home to the richest people on earth and famous for its age-old banks. and all that without fighting with anyone. peace brings more money in the end, swiss are richer than americans. and it actually doesn\u0026#039;t matter if people get annoyed at welfare or not. it\u0026#039;s possible to institute dictatorship and just take all the money from the people like happened in the ussr. you don\u0026#039;t need to hide from the public to rob people. in the case of Operation Northwoods there was a real enemy\u0026mdash;USSR. the plan was only trying to create pretext to attack cuba, not create the enemy as such. and if there\u0026#039;s an existing enemy, then there\u0026#039;s no need to create an enemy because there\u0026#039;s need to buy arms anyway. it boils down to whether you think communists and islamists are artificial enemies or real. if you want to say that they are commanded by the rothschilds, then where\u0026#039;s the evidence? there are 3 groups now: western world (romans), communist world (mongols) and islamic world (islamists). they are in conflict with each other. so there\u0026#039;s no need to create an enemy because for each group the other two groups are real and dangerous enemies. and because they are enemies, they cannot afford to waste money. for if money is wasted, the other two groups would gain an advantage\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: You\u0026#039;re trying to defend the US even after learning they were going to kill their own people?

ISIS only makes matters worse. now instead of one enemy, as it used to be during cold war, western world has 2 enemies. so now there is danger that communists or islamists may overcome western world because communists alone are formidable. the government could in theory create an enemy like ISIS if there was no other enemy. but there still was (and is) communist enemy which hasn\u0026#039;t been defeated. by the way, nazi germany also had central bank: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsbank\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e2: Yes, and it WASN\u0026#039;T (as far as I know) under control of the Rothschild\u0026#039;s.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e1: western world\u0026#039;s banks, corporations and governments are controlled by a tight group of people. i don\u0026#039;t agree they\u0026#039;re rothschilds, but they\u0026#039;re more or less one group of people. nazis were controlled by a different group of people. communists are also distinct from western group and also distinct from nazi group. so the western group and commie group allied against nazi group and won. and after that they started to wage war against each other. ussr has lost the war. so your point of view is that commie group is now part of western group. however, commies weren\u0026#039;t conquered. ussr was never occupied and denazified, in contrast to nazi germany. commies suffered a setback, and the western group tried to take their territory over. for example, expansion of EU. but they didn\u0026#039;t manage to realize it fully because neither russia nor china were really defeated. so the western group didn\u0026#039;t manage to use ussr dissolution to destroy communist group. now the communists are back with the help of china. so why would US need ISIS? western world still needs to overcome putin and china. they already have enemies, there\u0026#039;s no need to create new ones. it\u0026#039;s just a grave mistake that US allowed islamists to become new global group. while US and China/putin are now starting cold war II, islamists are using the moment to become stronger. while islamists have been under western and communist influence during the first cold war, now they have become a third player in the great game. bottom line, western group spends money on war out of necessity. when/if they defeat communists and islamists, then (if no new contender appears) they can simply use consumerism ideology to make people buy more and more, and the rulers will spend more and more government money on welfare, medicare and other similar programs\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003ePlease donate Bitcoin to this author: 1QFXJS8TeQUmgt97uFCWpjtu84vxcfcZAL\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='threadlink'\u003e\u0026#124;\u003ca href='/threads/44#157/_Internal_Mechanics_Of_Geopolitical_Conspiracies'\u003eReply in: Geopolitics\u003c/a\u003e\u0026#124;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='lines'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postingoid' id='156/The_Great_Software_Game'\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttitle'\u003eThe Great Software Game\u003c/div\u003e\u0026emsp;\u003cdiv class='postername'\u003ebigjoe\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='postertrip'\u003e!uV0kFwo8R2\u003c/div\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003cwbr\u003eNov\u0026nbsp;05,\u0026nbsp;2015\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='posttext'\u003eClosed source power group has finally made its move. SAGE has written many times about the overarching conflict between closed sourcers, open sourcers and public domainers. But now the reader may observe this struggle as it unfolds in broad daylight. Eric Raymond, a prominent BDFL, has issued a warning to everyone who tries to withstand NSA. According to his message, the feminists are trying to set up Torvalds and other leaders of the open source movement and make them go to jail or become double agents.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThe claim may seem outrageous for an uninitiated person, but there\u0026#039;s a precedent to it. Actually, many precedents, but let\u0026#039;s look at the one that is the most relevant. In 2010, several women lodged a statement with the police regarding alleged Julian Assange crimes. The reader probably already guessed that these crimes are sexual molestation and rape. This tactics is also nothing new. Over the course of history, women have brought down a great deal of men. For example, Dominique Strauss-Kahn\u0026mdash;who was later acquitted of charges, but only after he has lost his chance to become French president.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere should be made some distinction here; sometimes sexual relations cause harm by the natural course of events. What is meant by this is that the relationship wasn\u0026#039;t controlled by an external force. But in other cases, mostly connected to influential people, it is a product of someone\u0026#039;s intervention\u0026mdash;namely, NSA/KGB/some other spy agency. Keeping outstanding people under control is their primary task, and, judging by what Raymond says, they have already infiltrated feminist movement. To say the truth, evading personal attachments is a standard revolutionary practice known from time immemorial. The affection flaw is often present in women too, it is not a prerogative of men. So then why is Raymond mentioning it now? It is a clear signal that confrontation with closed sourcers has reached new heights. SAGE has written about how it is possible to use revolutionary techniques without actually doing the revolution. Any technique is simply a tool, after all. And these tools are important for public domainers, who sometimes get accused of paranoia because of their precautions.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eBut it is not that open sourcers do not have paranoia. The whole point is that open source leaders don\u0026#039;t want their followers to become adept at surviving geopolitical attacks. That's the reason behind timing of Raymond's post. As has been shown on SAGE, most of OSS leaders are BDFLs\u0026mdash;they don\u0026#039;t want to relinquish control. They only require for subordinates to know and practice enough skills to not lose all the money and power to closed sourcers. In other words, it\u0026#039;s a delicate balance between BDFLs ambitions, NSA reactionary forces and expendable parts of the politically active population. It\u0026#039;s really hard to transcend the artificial source duality. It\u0026#039;s what different flavors of public domainers do, but because of the associated difficulty public domain movement is small.\u003cinput type='checkbox' id='toggle156' class='checkboxes'\u003e\u003cdiv class='expanding'\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003clabel for='toggle156' class='expandlink'\u003eRead\u0026nbsp;More\u003c/label\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='cutting'\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eNow let\u0026#039;s get back to the case at hand. The assault started with artillery preparation: several months ago discussions about the code of conduct in LKML have started to spring up. After some time, kernel contributors began to resign. Obviously, open source clique detected the negative PR and reasoned that a big case is being prepared by special services. Hence, Raymond has acted. It\u0026#039;s true that LKML leaves a lot to be desired; but it\u0026#039;s also true that nothing is perfect. It\u0026#039;s also true that such issues are an ideal instrument for introducing agents of influence, hypertrophing distrust inside the group or replacing the key figure with a cooperating shill. Reformations should stem from those who want to do good, not from those who want to subvert. Public domain is not friends with open source, but not enemies either, at least for the time being.

Plants created using mutagenesis are sometimes called mutagenic plants or mutagenic seeds. From 1930 to 2014 more than 3200 mutagenic plant varietals have been released that have been derived either as direct mutants (70%) or from their progeny (30%). Crop plants account for 75% of released mutagenic species with the remaining 25% ornamentals or decorative plants. Although the FAO/IAEA reported in 2014 that over 1,000 mutant varietals of major staple crops were being grown worldwide, it is unclear how many of these varieties are currently used in agriculture or horticulture around the world, as these seeds are not always identified or labeled as being mutagenic or having a mutagenic provenance.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThere are different kinds of mutagenic breeding such as using chemical mutagens like EMS and DMS, radiation and transposons. Mutation breeding is commonly used to produce traits in crops such as larger seeds, new colors, or sweeter fruits, that either cannot be found in nature or have been lost during evolution. Exposing plants to radiation is sometimes called radiation breeding and is a subclass of mutagenic breeding. Radiation breeding was discovered in the 1920s when Lewis Stadler of the University of Missouri used X-rays on maize and barley. In the case of barley, the resulting plants were white, yellow, pale yellow and some had white stripes. In 1928, Stadler first published his findings on radiation-induced mutagenesis in plants. During the period 1930-2004, gamma rays were employed to develop 64% of the radiation-induced mutant varieties, followed by X-rays (22%). Radiation breeding may take place in atomic gardens; and seeds have been sent into orbit in order to expose them to cosmic radiation.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eAtomic gardening is a form of mutation breeding where plants are exposed to radioactive sources, typically cobalt-60. Beginning in the 1950s, atomic gardens were a part of Atoms for Peace, a program to develop peaceful uses of fission energy after WWII. One of the ideas was to bombard plants with radiation and produce lots of mutations, some of which, it was hoped, would lead to plants that bore more heavily or were disease or cold-resistant or just had unusual colors. Gamma gardens were established in laboratories in the US, Europe, parts of the former USSR, India and Japan. The gamma gardens were arranged in a circular pattern with a retractable radiation source in the middle. Plants were usually laid out like slices of a pie, radiating from the central radiation source; this pattern produced a range of radiation doses over the radius from the centre. The plants nearest the centre usually died, the ones further out often featured \u0026quot;tumors and other growth abnormalities\u0026quot;; beyond these were the plants of interest, with a higher than usual range of mutations, but not to the damaging extent of those closer to the radiation source.\u003cinput type='checkbox' id='toggle153' class='checkboxes'\u003e\u003cdiv class='expanding'\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003clabel for='toggle153' class='expandlink'\u003eRead\u0026nbsp;More\u003c/label\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class='cutting'\u003e\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHigh rates of chromosome aberrations resulting from ionizing radiation and the accompanied detrimental effects made researchers look for alternate sources for inducing mutations. As a result, an array of chemical mutagens has been discovered. The most widely used chemical mutagens are alkylating agents. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) is the most popular because of its effectiveness and ease of handling, especially its detoxiﬁcation through hydrolysis for disposal. Nitroso compounds are the other alkylating agents widely used, but they are light-sensitive and more precautions need to be taken because of their higher volatility. EMS has become a commonly used mutagen for developing large numbers of mutants for screening such as in developing TILLING populations. Although many chemicals are mutagenic, only few have been used in practical breeding as the doses need to optimised and also because the effectiveness is not high in plants for many.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eTransposon mutagenesis was first studied by Barbara McClintock in the mid-20th century during her Nobel Prize-winning work with corn. A transposable element or transposon is a DNA sequence that can change its position within the genome, sometimes creating or reversing mutations and altering the cell's genome size. Transposon mutagenesis is much more effective than chemical mutagenesis, with a higher mutation frequency and a lower chance of killing the organism. Other advantages include being able to induce single hit mutations, being able to incorporate selectable markers in strain construction, and being able to recover genes after mutagenesis. Signature-tagged mutagenesis is a technique used to study the function of genes. A transposon is allowed to integrate at random locations in the genome of the organism being studied. Mutants generated by this method are then screened for any unusual phenotypes. If such a phenotype is found then it can be assumed that the insertion has caused the gene relating to the usual phenotype to be inactivated. Because the sequence of the transposon is known, the gene can be identified, either by sequencing the whole genome and searching for the sequence, or using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify specifically that gene. Many other kinds of mutagenesis exist, such as those that employ combinatorics, homologous recombination or virus integration.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIn the debate over Genetically Modified foods, the use of transgenic processes is often compared and contrasted with mutagenic processes. While the abundance and variation of transgenic organisms in human food systems, and their effect on agricultural biodiversity, ecosystem health and human health is somewhat well documented, mutagenic plants and their role on human food systems is less well known. Though poorly known, radiation breeding has produced thousands of useful mutants and a sizable fraction of the world’s crops, including varieties of rice, wheat, barley, pears, peas, cotton, peppermint, sunflowers, peanuts, grapefruit, sesame, bananas, cassava and sorghum.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMutagenic varieties tend to be made freely available for plant breeding, in contrast to many commercial plant varieties or germplasm that increasingly have restrictions such as terms of use, patents and proposed genetic user restriction technologies. Unlike genetically modified crops, which typically involve the insertion of one or two target genes, plants developed via mutagenic processes with random, multiple and unspecific genetic changes have been discussed as a concern but are not prohibited by any nation\u0026#039;s organic standards. Somewhat controversially, several organic food and seed companies promote and sell certified organic products that were developed using both chemical and nuclear mutagenesis. Several certified organic brands, whose companies support strict labeling or outright bans on GMO-crops, market their use of branded wheat and other varietal strains which were derived from mutagenic processes without any reference to this genetic manipulation. These organic products range from mutagenic barley and wheat ingredient used in organic beers to mutagenic varieties of grapefruits sold directly to consumers as organic. As of 2011, the percentage of all mutagenic varietals released globally, by country, is: People\u0026#039;s Republic of China\u0026mdash;25.2%, Japan\u0026mdash;15.0%, India\u0026mdash;11.5%, Russia\u0026mdash;6.7%, Netherlands\u0026mdash;5.5%, Germany\u0026mdash;5.3%, United States\u0026mdash;4.3%.\u003cdiv class='parag'\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv
