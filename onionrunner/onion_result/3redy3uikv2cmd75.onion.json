In an ideal world, we would refuse to patent the software we invent. But this strategy would place the entire Bitcoin community at risk. […] Even when prior art exists that could challenge the validity of issued patents, such challenges are both difficult and expensive to mount, with often unpredictable results, and cannot be relied on as a solution. This leaves us with two choices: to work in secret, or to patent as a defensive strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe, then, that the way to ensure that our technology remains most usable is to obtain patents ourselves and make binding promises for their use. We look forward to a legislative environment where this is not needed: our strategy is not a substitute for attempts to reform or eliminate software patents, or to invalidate issued patents, including our own. But until we can ensure that no one can own exclusive rights to the technologies surrounding Bitcoin, we want to ensure that they remain available to the community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re glad to see Blockstream taking this step, and it’s provided an excellent template for other software companies to borrow.

The report highlighted the who, what, and why of content takedowns on social media sites. By cataloging and analyzing aggregated cases of social media censorship, Onlinecensorship.org unveils trends in content removals, provides insight into the types of content being taken down, and learns how these takedowns impact different communities of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eControversies over content takedowns seem to bubble up every few weeks, with users complaining about censorship of political speech, nudity, LGBT content, and many other subjects. The passionate debate about these takedowns reveals a larger issue: social media sites have an enormous impact on the public sphere, but are ultimately privately owned companies. Each corporation has their own rules and systems of governance that control users’ content, while providing little transparency about how these decisions are made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea for Onlinecensorship.org was born in 2011, when Facebook \u003ca href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/jun/09/palestinian-territories-gaza\"\u003etook down\u003c/a\u003e a link posted by popular band Coldplay.

Whether it’s a simple malfunction in a piece of computerized medical equipment or a malicious compromise of your networked car, it’s critically important that people working in security can find and fix the problem before the worst happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, an expansive United States law, passed in 1998 and emulated in legal codes all over the world, casts a dark legal cloud over the work of those researchers. It gives companies a blunt instrument with which to threaten that research, keeping potentially embarrassing or costly errors from seeing the light of day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat law is Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Simply put, Section 1201 means that you can be sued or even jailed if you bypass digital locks on copyrighted works—from DVDs to software in your car—even if you are doing so for an otherwise lawful reason, like security testing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gets worse: Section 1201’s speech restrictions also apply to scholars, artists, and activists that are seeking to comment on culture or make it more accessible. The tools to make engaging remixes, annotations, or interactive commentaries are in the hands of more and more people, but the law has created \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/11/eff-asks-librarian-congress-help-correct-dmca-gotcha\"\u003ea “gotcha” situation\u003c/a\u003e: while using that source material is legal, getting access to it might run afoul of these additional legal hurdles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can seek an exemption from the law to exercise a limited range of your fair use rights, but the avenue to do so is managed by an unsympathetic gatekeeper: the Library of Congress. The Librarian, working with the Register of Copyrights, has turned an already-onerous exemption process into legal obstacle course. And even if you win, you still have to come back every three years to do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intent behind that law was to create legal backing for \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/drm\"\u003eDRM\u003c/a\u003e—the software that adds restrictions to “content” like music, movies, and books.

Congress has the power to create copyright laws that “promote the progress of science and the useful arts,” but when it interferes with the traditional contours of copyright law, including fair use protections, it intrudes on the First Amendment. Section 1201 represents just such an intrusion, one that cannot pass constitutional scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEFF has filed a lawsuit today to address that constitutional issue, and we’ve gone into \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/section-1201-dmca-cannot-pass-constitutional-scrutiny\"\u003emore depth about the legal questions at hand in a companion post\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Congress passed Section 1201, the hot-button copyright debates were about the terms under which people could copy and consume music, movies, and books. Those are important issues, and there is still work to do in getting the balance right for the producers, distributors, and consumers of those works—especially considering that, more than ever before, people jump between all those roles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while that work continues, copyright law shouldn’t be casting a legal shadow over activities as basic as popping the hood of your own car, offering commentary on a shared piece of culture (and helping others do so), and testing security infrastructure.

It potentially implicates the entire range of speech that relies on access to copyrighted works or describes flaws in access controls—even where that speech is clearly noninfringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt EFF, we’ve been worried about this law since before it was passed. We were counsel in \u003ca href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5930508913825375010\"\u003eone of the first major tests of the law\u003c/a\u003e, but in those early days, we failed to convince the courts of its dangerous risk to speech. Ever since, we’ve documented those speech consequences. We’ve called on Congress to reform the law, to no avail. So today, we’re \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/1201-complaint\"\u003egoing to back to court\u003c/a\u003e, armed with nearly twenty years of knowledge about Section 1201’s interference with lawful speech and with key Supreme Court cases that have been decided in that time. For more about the problems caused by this law, see \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/research-and-remixes-law-wont-allow\"\u003eour companion post on the issue\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSection 1201 was billed as a tool to prevent infringement by punishing those who interfered with technological restrictions on copyrighted works. After the DMCA was passed, the Supreme Court was asked to evaluate other overreaching copyright laws, and offered new guidance on the balance between copyright protections and free speech. It found that copyright rules can be consistent with the First Amendment so long as they adhere to copyright’s \"traditional contours.\" These contours include fair use and the idea/expression dichotomy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dominant interpretation of Section 1201, however, can’t be squared with these First Amendment accommodations. As long as circumvention in furtherance of fair use risks civil damages or criminal penalties, Section 1201's barrier to noninfringing uses of copyrighted works oversteps the boundary set by the Supreme Court.\u003ci\u003e.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn First Amendment terms, the law is facially overbroad and therefore unconstitutional. By preventing valuable and noninfringing speech, it goes far beyond any restriction that might be justified by the purposes of copyright law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefenders of the law may point to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca-rulemaking\"\u003etriennial exemption process\u003c/a\u003e. But that rulemaking, which was intended as a protection for lawful speech, instead acts as an unconstitutional speech-licensing regime. To comply with the First Amendment, a speech-licensing regime must conform to strict safeguards to ensure that government officials issue timely permission according to strict standards, rather than exercising too much discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opportunity to seek government permission once every three years hardly provides for timely review, and in the most recent rulemaking, the government went so far as to claim that permission may be denied at the Librarian's discretion. It is also not enough to prove that you have the right to speak, the government demands that you show a widespread impact on others in a similar position, or you will be refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSection 1201 is a draconian and unnecessary restriction on speech and the time has come to set it aside. The future of cultural participation and software-related research depends on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"share-links\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eShare this: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Section%201201%20of%20the%20DMCA%20Cannot%20Pass%20Constitutional%20Scrutiny\u0026amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/section-1201-dmca-cannot-pass-constitutional-scrutiny\u0026amp;related=eff\u0026amp;via=eff\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/twitter48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?t=Section%201201%20of%20the%20DMCA%20Cannot%20Pass%20Constitutional%20Scrutiny\u0026amp;u=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/section-1201-dmca-cannot-pass-constitutional-scrutiny\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/facebook48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/section-1201-dmca-cannot-pass-constitutional-scrutiny\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/gplus48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Section%201201%20of%20the%20DMCA%20Cannot%20Pass%20Constitutional%20Scrutiny\u0026amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/section-1201-dmca-cannot-pass-constitutional-scrutiny\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/diaspora48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\" style=\"background-color: #cc0000; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; padding: 5px 8px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 8px;\"\u003eJoin EFF\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml\" title=\"Deeplinks\"\u003eEFF\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-lawsuit-takes-dmca-section-1201-research-and-technology-restrictions-violate\" lang=\"en\"\u003eEFF Lawsuit Takes on DMCA Section 1201: Research and Technology Restrictions Violate the First Amendment\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field field-name-field-pr-subhead field-type-text field-label-hidden\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-items\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-item even\"\u003eFuture of Technology and How It’s Used Is At Stake\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-items\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-item even\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eWashington D.C.—The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sued the U.S. government today on behalf of technology creators and researchers to overturn onerous provisions of copyright law that violate the First Amendment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003eEFF’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/1201-complaint\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elawsuit\u003c/a\u003e, filed with co-counsel Brian Willen, Stephen Gikow, and Lauren Gallo White of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich \u0026amp; Rosati, challenges the \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/drm\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eanti-circumvention\u003c/a\u003e and anti-trafficking provisions of the 18-year-old \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDigital Millennium Copyright Act\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca-rulemaking\"\u003eDMCA\u003c/a\u003e).

But using or offering this technology could run afoul of Section 1201.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"MsoNormal\"\u003e“Section 1201 prevents the act of creation from being spontaneous,’’ said Huang. “Nascent 1201-free ecosystems outside the U.S. are leading indicators of how far behind the next generations of Americans will be if we don’t end this DMCA censorship. I was born into a 1201-free world, and our future generations deserve that same freedom of thought and expression.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEFF is also representing plaintiff \u003ca href=\"https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/matthew-d-green/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMatthew Green\u003c/a\u003e, a computer security researcher at Johns Hopkins University who wants to make sure that we all can trust the devices that we count on to communicate, underpin our financial transactions, and secure our most private medical information.

The new \"Tor Onion Service Configuration\" setup is available on their website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Tor Project wants Tor privacy technology to be integrated into everyday life so that people don't have to log on to it—their privacy and security are built in.

Attackers stole 40 million credit card numbers after they hacked into a national retailer's HVAC system and used it to reach their computer system and their customers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTor has developed a way to build a buffer of privacy between the baby and the Internet--so that the baby (or the HVAC system) is never exposed to the open Internet at all. Instead of a hackable, single point of failure, attackers must contend with the global network of  thousands of Tor nodes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too many 'Things' in our homes, at our hospitals, in our businesses and throughout our lives are exposed to the public Internet without the ability to protect their communication.

Hollywood representatives routinely tell policymakers that the only response to the barrage of online infringement is to expand copyright or even create new copyright-adjacent rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew research from the United Kingdom paints a \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/20/oci-tracker-6th-wave-march-may-2016.pdf\"\u003every different picture of the state of online media consumption\u003c/a\u003e (PDF). The new report shows that unauthorized access to copyrighted media is on a steady decline, with only 5% of Internet users getting all of their online media through rogue methods, and only 15% of users consuming \u003ci\u003eany\u003c/i\u003e infringing content. \u003ca href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21696962-more-people-are-paying-stream-music-industry-still-wobbly-scales-dropped\"\u003eSimilar studies in the US\u003c/a\u003e have shown a steady decline in unauthorized downloads here too. The numbers show that if Hollywood really wants to curb infringing media consumption, the best thing it can do is \u003ci\u003eimprove its official offerings\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eConsumers Choose the Best Product\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past five years, the UK’s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) has produced a study on how people in the UK access content online, including both authorized and unauthorized methods. The latest report—\u003ca href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/07/04/internet-piracy-falls-to-record-lows-amid-rise-of-spotify-and-ne/\"\u003ereleased earlier this month\u003c/a\u003e—found that consumption of infringing content online is now at the lowest point it’s been for the history of the study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the key factors IPO found contributing to the decline is the rise of online subscription services—particularly for music. It’s easy to see why consumers are moving to services like Spotify for their music—they’re convenient for many users and they offer good selection. When IPO asked people what would make them stop accessing content via unauthorized methods, the most popular responses were to make legal services cheaper (24%) and for them to carry all of the content consumers want (20%).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIPO noted that when users choose where to get content online, legality isn’t much of a factor. Consumers look for convenience, selection, price, and quality. Simply put, listeners have moved to Spotify because they consider it the best product, legal or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast with music, infringement of films and TV shows went up slightly (though it was still minuscule compared to viewership via legal methods). Given users’ stated reasons for using infringing methods, it follows that the relatively limited selection of content on streaming video services has played a role in some consumers’ reluctance to switch to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, we’re not cheerleading for streaming services. Most of those services lock down media in digital rights management (DRM) technology. Thanks to \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/save-itunes\"\u003elaws in the U.S. and many other countries that make it a crime to circumvent DRM\u003c/a\u003e, streaming services create legal uncertainty over what consumers can do with the content they access, potentially \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/yes-all-drm\"\u003eoutlawing uses that wouldn’t otherwise constitute copyright infringement\u003c/a\u003e. The IPO report makes it clear that users are willing to pay for authorized methods of accessing content when those methods are the most convenient. If Hollywood invested in higher quality services for sharing content with fans that \u003ci\u003edidn’t\u003c/i\u003e rely on DRM, that would do nothing but ease consumers’ transition to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eISP “Education” Programs Don’t Work\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there might be disagreement about how the entertainment industry can create more loyal, paying customers, one thing is certain: pressuring Internet service providers to enforce copyright does very little to deter users.

Researchers have demonstrated how to compromise in-vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and control the vehicle maneuver. To counter these vulnerabilities, various types of defense mechanisms have been proposed, but they have not been able to meet the need of strong protection for safety-critical ECUs against in-vehicle network attacks. To mitigate this deficiency, we propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS), called \u003ci\u003eClock-based IDS\u003c/i\u003e (CIDS).  It measures and then exploits the intervals of periodic in-vehicle messages for fingerprinting ECUs. The thus-derived fingerprints are then used for constructing a baseline of ECUs' clock behaviors with the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm. Based on this baseline, CIDS uses Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) to detect any abnormal shifts in the identification errors -- a clear sign of intrusion. This allows quick identification of in-vehicle network intrusions with a low false-positive rate of 0.055%. Unlike state-of-the-art IDSs, if an attack is detected, CIDS's fingerprinting of ECUs also facilitates a rootcause analysis; identifying which ECU mounted the attack. Our experiments on a CAN bus prototype and on real vehicles have shown CIDS to be able to detect a wide range of in-vehicle network attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"http://inr.i2p/latest/\" title=\"inr.i2p latest hosts\"\u003eINR New Hosts\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://zerolag.i2p/?i2paddresshelper=vlYDMOLAfdXlu~y8aNdO-gRM3WK2svK3pUp-rfaVSmiApq~DhnyYssO6Q6rEL4gGJp1FJj2i2ZRh8MkRNEslGKYJ135ff~8UhHM8CpdS2SjjRxfwYM~bFyDBMJwIonszJj0btx8mSOLUnihX87p7oASuIhh0BXU0XwJoBTN30hs2FGXnbx~IVeJRs0MrHTjLxwBLQlwLLZfdC1VgPUmejWhvYbGw6j2yKil31K0xT7mNWQxWx7Sf0wolGw6acSAKTueY2KvszQC3cckOQuD1XTzizoPtQ2kiHFc22WEuHDWCqSnggjF~IWkKSC0urMuxIaCCABR-LoL6pcll2E80vDkO96Th5NtjrOrB4N~gi03-LaPKJXSSPNuCwvSvF35Urhgq~xbuz52ZjGPi9HoRHTT9A2DLDD9w86rhe2M~Hq10FXEy3mwmhDADAfBtxoeGBVuWM3o2zwuyWKqZHTP0GrG4Trm2ZeWUwQ91on-mXClwqTgPmg-YWvhV2PYOgH50BQAEAAEAAA==\" lang=\"en\"\u003ezerolag.i2p\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003eAuto-added from stats.i2p\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"http://xkcd.com/\" title=\"xkcd.com\"\u003eXKCD\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://xkcd.com/1709/\" lang=\"en\"\u003eInflection\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\u0026quot;Or maybe, because we're suddenly having so many conversations through written text, we'll start relying MORE on altered spelling to indicate meaning!\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Wat.\u0026quot;\" src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/inflection.png\" title=\"\u0026quot;Or maybe, because we're suddenly having so many conversations through written text, we'll start relying MORE on altered spelling to indicate meaning!\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Wat.\u0026quot;\" /\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 class=date\u003eJuly 19, 2016\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml\" title=\"Deeplinks\"\u003eEFF\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/russia-asks-impossible-its-new-surveillance-laws\" lang=\"en\"\u003eRussia Asks For The Impossible With Its New Surveillance Laws\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-items\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-item even\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s been a rough month for Internet freedom in Russia. After it breezed through the Duma, President Putin signed the “Yarovaya package\" into law—a set of radical “anti-terrorism” provisions drafted by ultra-conservative United Russia politician Irina Yarovaya, together with a set of instructions on how to implement the new rules. Russia’s new surveillance laws include some of Bad Internet Legislation’s greatest hits, such as mandatory data retention and government backdoors for encrypted communications—policies that EFF has opposed in every country where they’ve been proposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if that wasn’t scary enough, under the revisions to the criminal code, Russians can now be prosecuted for “\u003ca href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2016/06/24/russia-s-state-duma-just-approved-some-of-the-most-repressive-laws-in-post-soviet-history\"\u003efailing to report a crime\u003c/a\u003e.” Citizens now risk a year in jail for simply \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e telling the police about suspicions they might have about future terrorist acts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut some of the greatest confusion has come from Internet service providers and other telecommunication companies. These organizations now face impossible demands from the Russian state. Now they can be \u003ca href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/12/russia-big-brother-law-harms-security-rights\"\u003eordered to\u003c/a\u003e retain every byte of data that they transmit, including video, telephone calls, text messages, web traffic, and email for six months—a daunting and expensive task that requires the kind of storage capacity that’s usually associated with NSA data centers in Utah.  Government access to this data no longer requires a warrant. Carriers must keep all metadata for three years; ISPs one year. Finally, any online service (including social networks, email, or messaging services) that uses encrypted data is now required to permit the Federal Security Service (FSB) to access and read their services’ encrypted communications, including providing any encryption keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpposition to the Yarovaya package has come from many quarters. Technical experts have been united in opposing the law. Russia’s government Internet ombudsman opposed the bill. Putin’s own human rights head, \u003ca href=\"http://www.voanews.com/content/russian-rights-activists-denounce-counterrorist-legislation/3400516.html\"\u003eMikhail Fedotov\u003c/a\u003e, called upon the Senators of Russia’s Federal Council to reject the bill.

Putin has asked for a list of services that must hand over their keys. ISPs have begun to consider how to store an impossibly large amount of data. Service providers are required to consider how to either break unbreakable encryption or include backdoors for the Russian authorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is clear that foreign services will not be spared. Last week, the VPN provider, Private Internet Access (PIA), announced that \u003ca href=\"https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/discussion/21779/we-are-removing-our-russian-presence\"\u003ethey believed their Russian servers had been seized by the Russian authorities\u003c/a\u003e. PIA says they do not keep logs, so they could not comply with the demand, but they have now discontinued their Russian gateways and “will no longer be doing business in the region.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussia’s ISPs, messaging services, and social media platforms have no such choice: because they cannot reasonably comply with all the demands of the Yarovaya package, they become de facto criminals whatever their actions. And that, in turn, gives the Russian state the leverage to extract from them any other concession it desires. The impossibility of full compliance is not a bug—it’s an essential feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussia is not the only nation whose lawmakers and politicians are heading in this direction, especially when it comes to requiring backdoors for encrypted communications. Time and time again, technologists and civil liberties groups have warned the United States, \u003ca href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/01/13/france-encryption/\"\u003eFrance\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/01/06/netherlands-opposes-backdoors-but-encryption-still-under-assault/\"\u003eHolland\u003c/a\u003e, and a \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/06/un-special-rapporteur-calls-upon-states-protect-encryption-and-anonymity-online\"\u003ehost of other nations\u003c/a\u003e that the anti-encryption laws they propose cannot be obeyed without rewriting the laws of mathematics. Politicians have often responded by effectively telling the Internet’s experts “don’t worry, you’ll \u003ca href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/hillary-clinton-wants-manhattan-like-project-to-break-encryption/\"\u003ework out a way\u003c/a\u003e.” Let us be clear: government backdoors in encrypted communications make us all less safe, no matter which country is holding the keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnologists have sometimes believed that technical impossibility means that the laws are simply unworkable – that a law that cannot be obeyed is no worse than no law at all. As Russia shows, regulations that no one can comply with aren’t dead-letter laws. Instead, they corrode the rule of law, leaving a rusting wreckage of partial compliance that can be exploited by powers who will use their enforcement powers for darker and more partial ends than justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussians concerned with the fall of Internet freedom, including the Society for the Protection of the Internet (IPI), have planned a \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1764553853760156/\"\u003eprotest\u003c/a\u003e in cities across the country on July 26.

Estimating the difficulty of guessing or cracking a human-chosen password is very difficult. It was the primary topic of \u003ca href=\"http://jbonneau.com/doc/2012-jbonneau-phd_thesis.pdf\" title=\"Guessing human-chosen secrets\"\u003emy own PhD thesis\u003c/a\u003e and remains an active area of research. (One of many difficulties when people choose passwords themselves is that people \u003ca href=\"http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/\"\u003earen't very good at making random, unpredictable choices\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeasuring the security of a randomly-generated passphrase is easy. The most common approach to randomly-generated passphrases (immortalized \u003ca href=\"https://xkcd.com/936/\" title=\"Correct Horse Battery Staple\"\u003eby XKCD\u003c/a\u003e) is to simply choose several words from a list of words, at random. The more words you choose, or the longer the list, the harder it is to crack. Looking at it mathematically, for \u003cem\u003ek\u003c/em\u003e words chosen from a list of length \u003cem\u003en\u003c/em\u003e, there are \u003cem\u003ek\u003csup\u003en\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/em\u003e possible passphrases of this type. It will take an adversary about \u003cem\u003ek\u003csup\u003en\u003c/sup\u003e\u003c/em\u003e/2 guesses on average to crack this passphrase. This leaves a big question, though: where do we get a list of words suitable for passphrases, and how do we choose the length of that list?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral word lists have been published for different purposes; thus far, there has been little scientific evaluation of their usability. The most popular is Arnold Reinhold's \u003ca href=\"http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html\"\u003eDiceware list\u003c/a\u003e, first published in 1995. This list contains 7,776 words, equal to the number of possible ordered rolls of five six-sided dice (7776=6\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e), making it suitable for using standard dice as a source of randomness. While the Diceware list has been used for over twenty years, we believe there are several avenues to improve the usability and are introducing three new lists for use with a set of five dice (as part of its \u003ca href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/donate/summer-security-reboot\"\u003eSummer Security Reboot Campaign\u003c/a\u003e, EFF is providing a dice set to donors).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eEnhancements over the Diceware list\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Diceware list can provide strong security, but offers some challenges to usability. In particular, some of the words on the list can be hard to memorize, hard to spell, or easy to confuse with another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt contains many rare words such as \u003cem\u003eburet, novo, vacuo\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt contains unusual proper names such as \u003cem\u003edella, ervin, eaton, moran\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt contains a few strange letter sequences such as \u003cem\u003eaaaa, ll, nbis\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt contains some words with punctuation such as \u003cem\u003eain't, don't, he'll\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt contains individual letters and non-word bigrams like \u003cem\u003etl, wq, zf\u003cbr /\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt contains numbers and variants such as \u003cem\u003e46, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e99 \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e 99th\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt contains many vulgar words\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiceware passwords need spaces to be correctly decoded, e.g. \u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eput\u003c/em\u003e are in the list as well as \u003cem\u003einput\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote that several of these problems are exacerbated for users with a soft keyboard or other typing systems that relies on word recognition. Using only valid dictionary words makes this setup much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOur new \"long\" list\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first new list matches the original Diceware list in size (7,776 words (6\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e)), offering equivalent security for each word you choose. However, we have fixed the above problems, resulting in a list that is hopefully easy to type and remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe based our list off of data collected by Ghent University's \u003ca href=\"http://crr.ugent.be/\"\u003eCenter for Reading Research\u003c/a\u003e. The Ghent team has long studied word recognition; you can participate yourself in their online quiz to measure \u003ca href=\"http://vocabulary.ugent.be/\"\u003eyour English vocabulary\u003c/a\u003e. This list gives us a good idea of which words are most likely to be familiar to English speakers and eliminates most of the unusual words in the original Diceware list. This data also includes \"concreteness\" ratings for each words, from very concrete words (such as \u003cem\u003escrewdriver\u003c/em\u003e) to very abstract words (such as \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took all words between 3 and 9 characters from the list, prioritizing the most recognized words and then the most concrete words. We manually checked and attempted to remove as many profane, insulting, sensitive, or emotionally-charged words as possible, and also filtered based on several public lists of vulgar English words (for example \u003ca href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/resources/bad-words.txt\"\u003ethis one\u003c/a\u003e published by Luis von Ahn). We further removed words which are \u003ca href=\"http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/misspell.html\"\u003edifficult to spell\u003c/a\u003e as well as \u003ca href=\"http://www.singularis.ltd.uk/bifroest/misc/homophones-list.html\"\u003ehomophones\u003c/a\u003e (which might be confused during recall). We also ensured that no word is an exact prefix of any other word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt\"\u003eThe result is our own list of 7,776 words [.txt]\u003c/a\u003e suitable for use in dice-generated passphrases. The words in our list are longer (7.0 characters) on average, than Reinhold's Diceware list (4.3 characters). This is a result of banning words under 3 characters as well as prioritizing familiar words over short but unusual words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that the security of a passphrase generated using either list is identical; the differences are in usability, including memorability, not in security. For most uses, we recommend a generating a six-word passphrase with this list, for a strength of 77 bits of entropy. (\"Bits of entropy\" is a common measure for the strength of a password or passphrase. Adding one bit of entropy doubles the number of guesses required, which makes it twice as difficult to brute force.) Each additional word will strengthen the passphrase by about 12.9 bits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOur new \"short\" lists\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are also introducing new lists containing only 1,296 words (6\u003csup\u003e4\u003c/sup\u003e), suitable for use with four six-sided dice. By reducing the number of words in the list, we were able to use words with a maximum of five characters. This can lead to more efficient typing for the same security if it requires fewer characters to enter \u003cem\u003eN\u003c/em\u003e short words than \u003cem\u003eN-1\u003c/em\u003e long words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassphrases generated using the shorter lists will be weaker than the long list on a per-word basis (10.3 bits/word).  Put another way, this means you would need to choose more words from the short list, to get comparable security to the long list—for example, using eight words from the short will provide a strength of about 82 bits, slightly stronger than six words from the long list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_small_wordlist_1.txt\"\u003eThe first short list [.txt]\u003c/a\u003e is designed to include the 1,296 most memorable and distinct words. Our hope is that this approach might offer a usability improvement for longer passphrases. Further study is need to determine conclusively which list will yield passphrases that are easier to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_small_wordlist_2.txt\"\u003ewe're publishing one more short list [.txt]\u003c/a\u003e which with a few additional features making the words easy to type:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEach word has a unique three-character prefix.

This means that future software could correct any single typo in the user's passphrase (and in many cases more than one typo).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe've added these features in the hope that they might be used by software in the future that was specially designed to take advantage of them, but will not offer a significant benefit today so this list is mostly a proof-of-concept for individual users. Software developers might be able to find interesting uses for this list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSummary\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent lists might be preferable in different situations, and that's perfectly fine. For example, you might consider using one of the short lists when you are prioritizing ease of remembering, or when you know that the highest level of passphrase strength is not necessary. This might cover a website login that offers additional protections, like two-factor authentication, and that rate-limits guesses to protect against brute force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are typing the passphrase frequently (as opposed to using a passphrase database), you might prioritize reducing the length of the words. Our long list has an average length of 7.0 characters per word, and 12.9 bits of entropy per word, yielding an efficiency of 1.8 bits of entropy per character. Our short list has an average length of 4.5 characters per word, and 10.3 bits of entropy per word, yielding 2.3 bits of entropy per character. Our typo-tolerant list is much less efficient at only 1.4 bits of entropy per character. However, using a future autocomplete software feature, only three characters would need to be typed per word, in which case this would be the most efficient list to use at 3.1 bits of entropy per character typed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou might find the shorter average length in the original Diceware list to be preferable. That's perfectly fine as well, given the caveats we mentioned about the difficulty of using this list. Note that the original Diceware list offers 3.0 bits of entropy per character and hence less typing. As discussed above, we feel the large number of short words in this list (including single letters and bigrams) are hard to remember and hence a bad tradeoff to decrease typing time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince passphrases are individually chosen, it's okay for multiple lists to exist. In fact, this might even increase security, as it means the attacker has some uncertainty about which list was used to generate a passphrase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe think our lists will be useful for people generating passphrases using \u003ca href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/donate/summer-security-reboot\"\u003eEFF's dice\u003c/a\u003e (or otherwise), though they certainly aren't the last word on the matter. There's plenty of room for further research and experimentation on memorability and ways of optimizing lists and we hope people will keep exploring this area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ccenter\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSupport EFF's work during our Summer Security Reboot!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://eff.org/ssr.s\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"donate to EFF\" height=\"52\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2016/05/17/donate-bttn.png\" width=\"216\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"share-links\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eShare this: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Deep%20Dive%3A%20EFF%27s%20New%20Wordlists%20for%20Random%20Passphrases\u0026amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases\u0026amp;related=eff\u0026amp;via=eff\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/twitter48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?t=Deep%20Dive%3A%20EFF%27s%20New%20Wordlists%20for%20Random%20Passphrases\u0026amp;u=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/facebook48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/gplus48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Deep%20Dive%3A%20EFF%27s%20New%20Wordlists%20for%20Random%20Passphrases\u0026amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/diaspora48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\" style=\"background-color: #cc0000; color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; cursor: pointer; padding: 5px 8px; font-family: verdana; font-weight: bold; border-radius: 8px;\"\u003eJoin EFF\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/commits/master\" title=\"Recent Commits to i2pd:master\"\u003eI2Pd Source Checkins\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/commit/3f2119556fabffd28e91087ad880e87bfe5c002a\" lang=\"en-US\"\u003eupnp.name\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\u003cpre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; width: 81ex;\"\u003eupnp.name\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/commits/master\" title=\"Recent Commits to i2pd:master\"\u003eI2Pd Source Checkins\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/commit/77493d0d097527657d478191e31c876ed98602ad\" lang=\"en-US\"\u003econfigurable UPnP name\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\u003cpre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; width: 81ex;\"\u003econfigurable UPnP name\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/commits/master\" title=\"Recent Commits to i2pd:master\"\u003eI2Pd Source Checkins\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd/commit/340c73cbdfcd15a2362b383ed3488ec5b051a5b1\" lang=\"en-US\"\u003esend actual status back\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\u003cpre style=\"white-space: pre-wrap; width: 81ex;\"\u003esend actual status back\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003ca class=author href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/\" title=\"Schneier on Security\"\u003eSchneier on Security\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/07/stealing_money_.html\"\u003eStealing Money from ISPs Through Premium Rate Calls\u003c/a\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"content\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the best hacks are the ones that are obvious once they're explained, but no one has thought of them before. \u003ca href=\"https://www.arneswinnen.net/2016/07/how-i-could-steal-money-from-instagram-google-and-microsoft/\"\u003eHere's\u003c/a\u003e an example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstagram ($2000), Google ($0) and Microsoft ($500) were vulnerable to direct money theft via premium phone number calls.

That’s the good news. But the decision leaves unanswered so many other questions about how the law can be interpreted, and its rationale is so confusing, that it’s an invitation for more dangerous litigation and prosecutions under the CFAA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CFAA makes it illegal to engage in “unauthorized access” to any computer connected to the Internet. But the statue doesn’t say what “authorized access” means or make clear where authorization must come from. As we explain in an \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/ever-use-someone-elses-password-go-jail-says-ninth-circuit\"\u003eearlier post\u003c/a\u003e, under the rationale of last week’s decision in \u003ci\u003eNosal II\u003c/i\u003e (we call it \u003ci\u003eNosal II\u003c/i\u003e to differentiate it from an \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/nosal_en_banc.pdf\"\u003eearlier ruling\u003c/a\u003e in this long-running case), only the person or entity that owns the computer—not someone who just uses it or holds an account to use it—can “authorize” another person to access the computer. That would mean a spouse could not lawfully log into their partner’s bank account to pay a bill, even with their permission or at their request, so long as the spouse knows that she doesn’t have permission from the bank to access its servers. The Ninth Circuit’s rationale turned anyone who has ever used someone else’s password without the approval of the computer owner\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003einto a potential felon.

Power Ventures\u003c/i\u003e: The Facts\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ci\u003ePower\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003eVentures\u003c/i\u003e appeal, the company, a social media aggregator, was given usernames and passwords from Facebook users who wanted it to help them view all their social media information in one place. Power Ventures then asked for and received permission from the users to send invitations to those their contacts. Facebook objected to this and sent Power Ventures a cease and desist letter. It also blocked one of Power Venture’s IP addresses, although the block wasn’t effective because Power Ventures had many IP addresses. The company continued to offer its social media aggregating services to Facebook users for a month or so, until Facebook blacklisted the phrase “Power.com.”  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook also sued Power Ventures, arguing that it violated the CFAA, the corresponding state law in California (California Penal Code § 502), and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-103\"\u003eCAN-SPAM Act\u003c/a\u003e—the federal law that prohibits sending commercial emails with “materially misleading” header information. More on that CAN-SPAM claim below. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe district court \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/court-finds-social-network-add-violated-spam-hacking-laws\"\u003eruled\u003c/a\u003e back in 2012 that Power Ventures was liable to Facebook under the CFAA, the state law, and CAN-SPAM Act and, in 2013, ordered it and CEO Steven Vachani, personally, to pay Facebook a crazy amount—more than $3 million in damages. Power Ventures appealed, and EFF filed an \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/eff-ninth-circuit-amicus-brief\"\u003eamicus brief\u003c/a\u003e in support of the company and argued at the Ninth Circuit hearing about the danger of extending crippling civil and criminal liability on services that provide competing or follow-on innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Ninth Circuit’s \u003ci\u003eFacebook v. Power\u003c/i\u003e Decision\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ninth Circuit found that Power Ventures violated the CFAA when it accessed Facebook’s data after receiving the cease and desist letter, on the ground that the letter gave the company notice that Facebook had revoked its authorization to access users’ Facebook accounts. The court acknowledged that Facebook users \u003ci\u003ecould\u003c/i\u003e give Power Ventures valid authorization to access their accounts without running into a CFAA violation—the step back from \u003ci\u003eNosal II’s\u003c/i\u003e blanket criminalization of password sharing. That was true even though Facebook’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/terms\"\u003eterms of service\u003c/a\u003e expressly prohibit password sharing or letting anyone else use your account. But, according to the court, “[t]he consent that Power had received from Facebook users was not sufficient to grant continuing authorization to access Facebook’s computers after Facebook’s express revocation of permission.” Because Power “unequivocally” knew that it no longer had authorization \u003ci\u003efrom Facebook\u003c/i\u003e to access Facebook’s computers and continued to do so anyway, it violated the CFAA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if we’ve got this right, an authorized user can designate someone to use their account even if the Terms of Service or other contractual agreement expressly forbids it, but if the computer owner then says “no” again, somehow that authority is lost and continued use is a crime. Huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThankfully, the court got things right as far as Facebook’s CAN-SPAM claims were concerned. Facebook argued that the promotional messages its users sent their friends inviting them to try Power Ventures were “materially misleading”—and thus illegal—because the messages appeared to come from Facebook rather than from the users or Power Ventures. But that’s how Facebook set up its messaging system. The Ninth Circuit acknowledged, rightfully, that there was nothing misleading about the invitations. Any Facebook user that received an invitation to try Power would be able to tell that there were three separate parties involved: the friend, who sent the invite; Facebook, who facilitated the message; and Power, who’s service was being promoted. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eUnanswered Questions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we’re happy the court made it clear that using another person’s passwords in the first instance is OK, even despite a contractual agreement or terms of service forbidding it, the Ninth Circuit’s \u003ci\u003ePower Ventures \u003c/i\u003edecision raises a host of new and unanswered questions about the scope of the CFAA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe central problem is that, in both \u003ci\u003ePower\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003eVentures \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eNosal II\u003c/i\u003e, by turning criminal liability on what someone knows or is told, the court seems to lose sight of the original goal of CFAA—targeting individuals who \u003ci\u003ebreak into\u003c/i\u003e computer systems. Indeed, in the 2012 en banc \u003ci\u003eNosal I \u003c/i\u003edecision, the Ninth Circuit \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/ninth-circuit-en-banc-opinion\"\u003erejected\u003c/a\u003e turning the CFAA “into a sweeping Internet-policing mandate,” choosing instead to “maintain[] the CFAA’s focus on hacking[.]” Yet in \u003ci\u003ePower Ventures\u003c/i\u003e (and earlier in \u003ci\u003eNosal II\u003c/i\u003e), there was no “breaking into” a computer; in both cases, legitimate passwords were used with the permission of the account holders. As a result, the \u003ci\u003ePower Ventures \u003c/i\u003ecourt stretched the law to apply where it really wasn’t meant to go, turning criminal liability on Power Ventures' knowledge that Facebook revoked its “authority” to use those absolutely still good passwords. And because these decisions reach beyond the issue of breaking into computers, they suddenly implicate questions about the application of the CFAA to public websites, which have no technological barriers to access. (The court dropped a footnote saying that it wasn’t answering this question, but the fact that it felt the need to mention this was troubling. The CFAA \u003ci\u003eshould not\u003c/i\u003e reach that far.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe decision also raises important questions about what notice or revocation means. Do you need to receive a written cease and desist letter? If a bank sends you a notice saying that your partner can no longer log into your account, is it a crime if they log in to pay a bill? What if it sends that notice to all its customers? Or can a website just post a notice, directed at all users, about conditions under which authorization is considered revoked? While the court seems clear that notice via terms of service is insufficient, it sheds no light on what sufficient notice looks like. It also seems disingenuous to \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/07/12/9th-circuit-its-a-federal-crime-to-visit-a-website-after-being-told-not-to-visit-it/\"\u003edraw a line\u003c/a\u003e between access revocations contained within a subsequent notice and restrictions contained within terms of use or other up-front agreements, but it seems like that’s what the court is doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, if a computer system owner doesn’t like how someone is using a computer—whether directly or through someone else—the remedy should be terminating the user’s credentials, \u003cu\u003enot\u003c/u\u003e suing or seeking criminal indictment of the person using the legitimate credentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese questions remain unanswered and leave many situations unclear, convoluting the good Ninth Circuit precedent of \u003ci\u003eNosal I\u003c/i\u003e. And that’s important because even though \u003ci\u003ePower \u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003eVentures \u003c/i\u003eis a civil case, the CFAA is a criminal statute and \u003ca href=\"http://definitions.uslegal.com/r/rule-of-lenity/\"\u003emust provide\u003c/a\u003e adequate notice of exactly what conduct is criminalized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re glad the Ninth Circuit rejected the district court’s absurd extension of the CAN-SPAM Act and stepped back a bit from \u003ci\u003eNosal II’s\u003c/i\u003e dangerous language. But the unanswered questions it raises for the CFAA may prove highly problematic. En banc review of both cases is necessary to bring clarity back to the Ninth Circuit’s interpretation of the CFAA—and to ensure that the law maintains its focus on computers break-ins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field field-name-field-related-cases field-type-node-reference field-label-above\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-label\"\u003eRelated Cases: \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-items\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"field-item even\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/cases/u-s-v-nosal\"\u003eUnited States v.

Informed by situational crime prevention (SCP) this study evaluates the effectiveness of the \"West Bank Barrier\" that the Israeli government began to construct in 2002 in order to prevent suicide bombing attacks.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMethods -- Drawing on crime wave models of past SCP research, the study uses a time series of terrorist attacks and fatalities and their location in respect to the Barrier, which was constructed in different sections over different periods of time, between 1999 and 2011.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eResults -- The Barrier together with associated security activities was effective in preventing suicide bombings and other attacks and fatalities with little if any apparent displacement. Changes in terrorist behavior likely resulted from the construction of the Barrier, not from other external factors or events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eConclusions -- In some locations, terrorists adapted to changed circumstances by committing more opportunistic attacks that require less planning. Fatalities and attacks were also reduced on the Palestinian side of the Barrier, producing an expected \"diffusion of benefits\" though the amount of reduction was considerably more than in past SCP studies. The defensive roles of the Barrier and offensive opportunities it presents, are identified as possible explanations. The study highlights the importance of SCP in crime and counter-terrorism policy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the whole paper is behind a paywall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNote: This is not a political analysis of the net positive and negative effects of the wall, just a security analysis.

That's because DRM -- unlike all the other technology that the W3C has ever standardized — enjoys unique legal protection under a tangle of international laws, like the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Canada's Bill C-11, and EU laws that implement Article 6 of the EUCD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder these laws, companies can threaten legal action against researchers who circumvent DRM, even if they does so for lawful purposes, like disclosing security vulnerabilities. Last summer, a who's-who America's most esteemed security researchers \u003ca href=\"http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/comments-020615/\"\u003efiled comments with the US Copyright Office\u003c/a\u003e warning the agency that they routinely discovered vulnerabilities in systems from medical implants to voting machines to cars, but were advised not to disclose those discoveries because of the risk of legal reprisals under Section 1201 of the DMCA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrowsers are among the most common technologies in the world, with literally billions of daily users. Any impediment to reporting vulnerabilities in these technologies has grave implications. Worse: HTML5 is designed to provide the kind of rich interaction that we see in apps, in order to challenge apps' dominance as control systems for networked devices.  That means browsers are now intended to serve as front-ends for pacemakers and cars and home security systems. Now more than ever, we can't afford any structural impediments to identification and disclosure of browser defects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a way to reconcile the demands of browser vendors and movie studios with the security of the web: last year, we \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/w3c-eme-and-eff-frequently-asked-questions\"\u003eproposed\u003c/a\u003e an extension to the existing W3C policy on patents, which says that members are forbidden from enforcing their patent rights to shut down implementations of W3C standards.  Under our proposal, this policy would also apply to legal threats under laws like the DMCA. Members would agree upon a mutually acceptable, binding covenant that forbade them from using the DMCA and its global analogs to attack security researchers who revealed defects in browsers and new entrants into the browser market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, the W3C has \u003ca href=\"http://boingboing.net/2016/06/18/w3c-drm-working-group-chairman.html\"\u003erejected this proposal\u003c/a\u003e, despite \u003ca href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/03/security-researchers-tell-w3c-protect-researchers-who-investigate-browsers\"\u003ebroad support from security and privacy professionals\u003c/a\u003e around the world, and despite new evidence of the need to investigate technical flaws in the EME specification.

How will the bill affect law enforcement use of drones?

Further, given the nature of aerial surveillance it would be almost impossible to ensure that any data gathered by a drone comes solely from public property (except, perhaps, deep inside a state park).

At these competitions, drone pilots engage in dogfights involving rudimentary weapons, such as net guns or dangled pieces of wire meant to jam an opponent’s drone’s propellers.

We’ve seen police around the country arrest and suspend students for activities like bringing a homemade clock to school or chewing a toaster pastry into the shape of a gun.

ASL is currently partnered with Hiller Aviation Museum, The Innovation Hangar at the Palace of Fine Arts, and other institutions to provide ongoing drone build-a-thon workshops for youth and adults, sharing the skills needed to build, safely fly—and register your drone with the FAA. These ASL initiatives are due in part to drone combat games’ accessibility for enthusiasts young and old as a gateway to computer programming, math, science, engineering and so many other beneficial skills. In fact, many of our competitors are youth who see drone sports as a way to pursue larger educational futures in aviation, engineering, and technology.

The trick is striking the right balance—ensuring that new laws and regulations protect our privacy and safety without restricting the technology’s use any more than necessary. Unfortunately, these bills were an overreaction to some of the hysteria about private use of drones and didn’t strike that balance. Also, they did not sufficiently limit police use of drones.

When launching Binge On late last year, T-Mobile loudly proclaimed that it “optimized” data for mobile devices, which certainly sounds like a good thing. Sadly, EFF’s test showed T-Mobile wasn’t being entirely truthful: the “optimization” was actually just throttling, and T-Mobile was also throttling some video it wasn’t zero-rating—which meant that in some cases customers were getting lower quality video and still having to pay for it. Not so good, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe researchers at Northeastern and USC confirmed that Binge On works by throttling video data to 1.5Mbps without doing any sort of optimization. But the researchers went even further, showing how Binge On can result in worse-quality video (especially for mobile devices with high-resolution screens), and explaining how it could also result in decreased battery lifetime (due to the longer download times Binge On causes).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they didn’t stop there. They actually reverse-engineered the classifier T-Mobile uses to decide whether or not data should be zero-rated. In other words, they figured out exactly what parts of a data stream T-Mobile looks at to decide if a flow of packets should count against a customer’s data cap or not, and which values triggered zero-rating. With that knowledge in hand, they also figured how to subvert the classifier into zero-rating \u003ci\u003eany\u003c/i\u003e data—not just video streams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSuper-Technical Digression\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one technical discrepancy between the researchers’ findings and our findings from back in January. The researchers found that changing the “Content-Type” HTTP header from “video/mp4” to something else prevents T-Mobile from recognizing that a file is actually video, and thus causes Binge On not to throttle or zero-rate the file. Our test, on the other hand, showed that changing the file extension (and thus the Content-Type header) \u003ci\u003ewasn’t\u003c/i\u003e sufficient—T-Mobile still recognized the file as video and throttled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo figure out the source of the discrepancy, we ran our test again, and also provided a packet log of our test to the researchers. They confirmed our results, and also ran some different tests to explore further what was going on. Together, we realized that \u003ci\u003eboth \u003c/i\u003eof our results were correct. That’s because in addition to matching against the “Content-Type” header, T-Mobile \u003ci\u003ealso\u003c/i\u003e scans the first response packet for the string “mp4.” (This string was present in the video file we used for EFF’s tests, since it’s part of the \u003ca href=\"http://xhelmboyx.tripod.com/formats/mp4-layout.txt\"\u003eheaders of the file itself\u003c/a\u003e.) If either match is found, Binge On throttles the stream. Thus, our test with different headers \u003ci\u003edid\u003c/i\u003e show throttling, since our file had the string “mp4” in it. And the researchers’ test with different headers \u003ci\u003edidn’t\u003c/i\u003e show throttling, because the content payload in their test didn’t include the magic string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNon-CS Folks Can Start Reading Again\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither way, the fundamental point is that T-Mobile is doing deep-packet inspection to support a brittle zero-rating service that discriminates against edge providers who don’t want to make a private deal with T-Mobile. As a result, Binge On throttles—not optimizes—video regardless of whether or not it’s zero-rated, sometimes resulting in a poorer video streaming experience for T-Mobile customers. We said it back in January, and the researchers at Northeastern and USC have done a great job confirming it and going much, much farther to document it methodically and in rigorous detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile T-Mobile has made some positive changes since January (they’ve made it much easier to disable or re-enable Binge On, they’re now allowing edge providers to opt out, and their explanation of how Binge On works is more accurate), Binge On still suffers from two fundamental violations of net neutrality principles. First, it only applies to video, which means other large downloads or types of streaming data don’t get the same zero-rating treatment, thus putting artificial limits on how customers can choose to use their data. And second, it still puts T-Mobile in the position of acting as gatekeeper, forcing video providers to ask T-Mobile’s permission to get zero-rated. That’s an extra barrier that shouldn’t exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"share-links\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eShare this: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Researchers%20Confirm%20EFF%E2%80%99s%20Binge%20On%20Findings%E2%80%94And%20Learn%20How%20to%20%20Get%20Binge%20On%20to%20Zero-Rate%20Everything\u0026amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/researchers-confirm-effs-binge-findings-and-learn-how-get-binge-zero-rate\u0026amp;related=eff\u0026amp;via=eff\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/twitter48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?t=Researchers%20Confirm%20EFF%E2%80%99s%20Binge%20On%20Findings%E2%80%94And%20Learn%20How%20to%20%20Get%20Binge%20On%20to%20Zero-Rate%20Everything\u0026amp;u=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/researchers-confirm-effs-binge-findings-and-learn-how-get-binge-zero-rate\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/facebook48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/researchers-confirm-effs-binge-findings-and-learn-how-get-binge-zero-rate\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/gplus48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Researchers%20Confirm%20EFF%E2%80%99s%20Binge%20On%20Findings%E2%80%94And%20Learn%20How%20to%20%20Get%20Binge%20On%20to%20Zero-Rate%20Everything\u0026amp;url=https%3A//www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/researchers-confirm-effs-binge-findings-and-learn-how-get-binge-zero-rate\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/supporters/images/diaspora48.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\" style=\"background-color: #cc0000;
