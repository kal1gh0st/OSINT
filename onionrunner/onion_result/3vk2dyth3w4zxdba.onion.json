As these tools come into more demand, simpler documentation is vital to enable widespread usage.  One critical tool among these counter-measures are web sites hosted on the Tor public anonymity network.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nNo single tool can solve every need.  This applies to every piece of software, and no less than to Tor and its various functions.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nBut Tor hidden web sites remain an underutilized solution that can provide targets of censorship and surveillance a method of bypassing their adversary's restrictive measures.  An \"adversary\" can include an array of entities, such as workplaces with filtered internet access, to internet service providers and large, global-reaching intelligence agencies.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nPublic web sites can be identifed and located, and therefore blocked and seized.  The web site's domain name is filed with a registrar.   The internet address that allows it to be accessed on the internet is owned by an internet service provider.  The web site's connection to the internet is enabled by an internet service provider.  All of these components are easy to identify, and therefore legally or physically to coerce.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nBut Tor hidden web sites reside only on the Tor network.  The domain name is randomly generated by the hidden web server.  It is extremely difficult to physically locate the web server on the internet.  Web site visitors rely on the Tor network to route to the hidden web site.  With proper configuration, they allow for web sites that bypass any \"take-down\" measures, including domain name seizures through the registrar or with most common denial of service attacks.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWhat You Should Understand Already\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis piece is aimed at providing basic guidance in configuring Tor hidden web sites.  It is addressed to reasonably technical people who do not necessarily have advanced Tor or web server configuration experience.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAn implementer should be comfortable installing up a web server.  In this piece, thttpd, nginx and lighttpd are the focus.  We also are assuming a basic level of familiarity with any common Unix-like open source operating system such as a Linux distribution or BSD.  The user should be able to install and configure applications, edit configuration files, restart services and other basic tasks.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWhat Is Not Covered\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nMicrosoft's Windows, Apple's OSX and other closed source operating systems are not included in this piece.  Closed source operating systems are frequently less secure.  More importantly, they more easily able to secretly communicate with remote hosts with background processes which can potentially disclose the true role of a hidden server.  But open source operating systems should not be viewed as safe by default.  Besides known and undiscovered vulnerabilities, some operating systems, such as Ubuntu, are becoming connected with larger data mining systems.  Ultimately, the implementer should use the operating system they are most familiar with, and also understand how to configure and restrict various services to minimize potential breaches.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe popular Apache web server is not included in this piece.  A default Apache install is large and requires steps beyond the scope of this document to minimize its footprint.  More advanced users who do want to use Apache for hidden web sites should look to remove most of the modules in the default configuration.  For users familiar with OpenBSD's version of Apache, it should be noted that the heavy scrutiny from the developers make this an ideal choice for hidden web sites.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nWeb developers often view web sites as a mosaic of scripts, languages and dynamic content.  Web site data updates regularly, and present pages based on the user's browser version, the language identified with the user and so on.  But for this piece, the setup is meant for simple and static web sites that may have seem more appropriate for 1996 than for more than a decade into the 21st century.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nIt is vital to understand why hidden web sites should not contain heavy scripting and many of the contemporary web site technologies.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFirst, a lot of the current web site tools, such as JavaScript and cookies, can compromise a web site visitor's identity.  Second, many of those technologies reveal information about the hidden web site including operating system, internet address and time zone.  Finally, most of these technologies are blocked by the default Tor Browser, and will not work for Tor users.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe guiding principle of this piece is to instruct others in configuring safe and anonymous web sites on the Tor network, with very basic web server functionality.  Once anonymity is broken, it can not be regained.  A new hidden web site must be created on a new host, but any identity information revealed must be accounted for.  For whistleblowsers and similar users, this much be understood.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn a scale with anonymity and security on the one side, and functionality and usability on the other side, this piece weighs heavily toward the former over the latter.  A fully function and user friendly web site will undercut anonymity and security.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWhat Can Hidden Web Sites Do for You?\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nIn the most general way, there are three core functions that a hidden web site might perform:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\nThe \"Whistleblower Scenario\":  There are various methods by which whistleblowers publicize their findings.  Hidden web sites are an underutilized tool for this purpose.  Hidden web sites can not be geographically located, and internet service providers can not shut them down.  The data remains available regardless of measures implemented on the public internet.   The whisteblower can anonymous, and the exposed data speaks for itself.\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\nThe \"Unacceptible Content Scenario\":  Different nation-states and entities use censorship to restrict internet content.  In some cases, one might personally find these restrictions acceptible.  In other cases, one may not.  The internet began as a very much uninhibited virtual place, without any type of censorship, with the posting of materials often found immoral or illegal.  The question remains: who is determining what is \"immoral\" or \"illegal\"?  Throughout history, US authorities banned books deemed \"unacceptible\", including some of the more popular writers for children such as Judy Bloom.  It was certainly illegal for abolitionists to call for uprising against slavery in the antebellum American south.  Publishing materials considered subversive by one or another despot around the world today can lead to imprisonment or worse.  In such cases, hidden web sites are an ideal tool.\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e\nAs an organizing tool: The social explosions in North Africa over the past several years prompted some nation-states to block popular web sites which serve as information sources.  And repressive methods often focus on curtailing the internet as an organizing tool.  Yet hidden web sites can assist in bypassing those measures.  Whether hosted within the adversarial nation-state or not, a hidden web site can become a central place for information to be deposited and distributed.  Of course upon identification, anyone can see the data on such a hidden web site, and the most technologically unsavvy regime catches up at some point when its very existence is at stake.  But information about conditions, events and large scale, simultaneous resistance activities is vital to any mass movement gaining momentum.  In many cases, a weak movement may endanger itself by publicizing future, above-ground activities.  But before it gains strength, other activities can be coordinated and also publicized.\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nHow Tor Works\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nTor is a public network residing on top of the internet and is composed of thousands of computers.  They relay information between themselves using encryption, and creating a hidden network within the public internet.  A user might employ Tor to browse the internet anonymously.  With the Tor Browser, a user connects to the Tor network, and visits a web site while traversing through three different Tor relays.  This obscures the user from the web site destination.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis connection, composed of the three relays in the Tor network, is called a \"circuit.\"  The circuit changes every ten minutes, and a new combination of relays becomes the next circuit.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nOther functions, not just web browsing, can take place over the Tor network, such as email and various chat-type software such as IRC.  All are useful for bypassing censorship and hiding the identity of the user as they visit internet web sites.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe primary benefit is that the destination, in this case a web site, thinks that the remote user is arriving from the last internet address in the circuit.  The first relay in the circuit is able to identify the user, it is not possible to know where the user is going.  The middle relay in the circuit only knows it is talking to the first and last relay, with no knowledge of who the user is, and where that user is going.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFrom the user to the last relay in the circuit, all communications are encrypted and therefore private.  A connection on the public internet that is using HTTP instead of HTTPS does not encrypt the last part of the circuit to the web site destination.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe technical concept behind this is called \"onion routing\", and further understanding the idea is strongly encouraged.  But for the purposes of this piece, this should suffice as a general picture of the Tor network's operation.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nHow Hidden Web Sites Work\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhen those thousands of relays interact in the Tor network, they create the basis of something often called a \"darknet.\"  It is a version of the internet but all communications are encrypted internally, and other services, such as web hosting, can reside untrackable.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nA hidden web site runs on a computer that is part of the Tor network, interacting with the relays.  It can itself as a relay so long as it is configured to be on the Tor network.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhen the Tor hidden web site is created, a hostname is generated composed of a \"hash\" of numbers and letters.  Once the Tor computer hosting the hidden web site joins the Tor network, the site is registered, and it is then reachable by other remote computers.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe public internet version of this occurs as web sites maintain a domain name, which the domain naming system aligns with an internet address, allowing the user to type in a domain name yet ultimately arrive at a web site.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn the public internet, web sites are accessible by domain name, such as example.com, with the \".com\" part identified as the top-level domain.  But on the Tor network, domain names are generated cryptographically, and web sites all maintain the top-level domain of \".onion.\"  Typing a web site address with .onion while not on the Tor network does not work.  The public internet knows how to route .com, .net, .edu, and so on, but .onion is not recognized.  Only on the Tor network will .onion operate.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nA Tor hidden web site is composed of a computer on the Tor network running a web server.  The web server listens only over the port that is speaking to the Tor network, and not to the public internet.  A stable internet connection is necessary, in addition to a secure operating system.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nOperating System Considerations\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs mentioned earlier, the best operating system for hidden web sites is the operating system that the user is most comfortible in configuring.  However, this document is focused on free Unix-like systems due to their ability to be more secure for the purposes of web site hosting.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThere are the obvious aspects of running a secure public web server that also applies to Tor hidden web sites.  This includes making sure that the operating system is current and fully patched.  The minimal number of services should be running on the system.  Multitasking other services on a Tor hidden web server is not recommended.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nA host-based firewall should also be used.  For the operation of a Tor hidden service, no ports other than the \"ORPort\" as listed in the torrc file is necessary.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nDangers to the Anonymity of a Hidden Web Site\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nBesides preventing leaks with a secure operating system and careful configuration of web server software, there are other issues to consider.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nA hidden web site that is accessible on the public internet can betray its identity.  By simply using a search engine, text from a hidden web site could be found on a public internet web site.  If a hidden web site is used to maintain a user's anonymity, then replicating that information on the public internet is dangerous.  Hidden web site content should not also be hosted on the public internet.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAnother important consideration is maintaining accurately synchronized time.  Most systems provide network time synchronization with ntpd.  Any drift in time could potentially reveal the identity of a Tor hidden web site to a powerful adversary.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe actual web site files, the source of the HTML, can also provide identifying information.  While the text might not be visibile directly to a web site visitor, it is easily accessible using any contemporary web browser.  Information such as the program used to write the HTML code or the author may be revealed.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nBasic Tor Configuration\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe basic configuration file for a Tor host is the torrc file.  The file is very large, and can be inimidating, but it contains mostly comments and instructions for performing various tasks with Tor, such as running a hidden web site.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor the most basic functionality as a hidden web server, the torrc file only needs to include several lines.

The list of relays is publicly available, and a smart adversary might connect the availability of that relay with the hidden web site.\n\n\u003chr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nTor Configuration for Hidden Web Sites\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nLooking at a default torrc file, there is a section denoted with \"this section is just for location-hidden services\" comment.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAdding a hidden web site is simple.  The torrc file indicates where the hidden service's hostname and private_key files are, in addition to the port the service should be listening on.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor example, the following torrc entry:\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\nHiddenServiceDir\n\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\n/var/db/tor/hidden_www0\n\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nindicates that this hidden service's Tor information resides in the listed directory.  Therefore, that directory should contain both the hostname and private_key files once Tor is started.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe next line then needs to indicate the port on which the service is listening.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd\u003e\nHiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80\n\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis indicates that all requests to the first port 80 should be redirected to port 80 on the local computer.  \"127.0.0.1\" is the local computer's address that is only accessible on the local computer.  This forces redirects the web server softwares requests to speak to the local computer.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nSetting Up a Web Servers for Use as a Hidden Service\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe next step is to configure a web server.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThere are three different web servers approached: thttpd, nginx and lighttpd.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs stated above, the web sites should be simply configured with static web pages, with the minimum add-ons to avoid compromising the location and identity related information about both the remote user and the web server.  All three selected web server softwares are functional in their default configuration, and do not include the ability to even utilize scripting such as PHP.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs an implementer's competency and understanding of Tor and hidden web sites increases, not to mention additional research on the topic by the security community, further complexity can be integrated.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nUsers might consider adding SSL/TLS encryption to their hidden web site.  It is a logical thought for anyone looking to provide a basic level of privacy to a web site.  This is an unncessary step for hidden web sites.  Tor hidden web sites are in the Tor network itself, and all communications are already encrypted.  But it is not just redundant to use SSL/TLS encryption, since certificate information could betray information about the location and identity of the web site.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAs a side note, confirm that the \"localhost\" resolves to 127.0.0.1.  With some virtualized systems, the localhost's host section of the address, usually \"1\", might be another number.  This can be tested by pinging the localhost with the command \"ping localhost.\"\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nThe First Run of a Tor hidden web service\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nOnce the hidden web server is configured, restart Tor.  This will generate two vital files with the tor/hidden_www directory.  First, the cryptographic hostname.  While is may seem awkward, it is a randomly generated hostname that should not reveal the server's actual public address.  Second, a private key is also created.  The hostname is the web site's identifier, and should be distributed to anyone who needs access.  The private key is k\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nUsing thttpd\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe last release of thttpd was in 2003, with no changes to the software since.  This does not mean the software is full of vulnerabilities and performance issues.  It is because thttpd was built as a light-weight web server, with minimal default functionality, and there is less room for errors than for larger, more complex web server software.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe actual operation of a server delivering basic HTML files to remote users is simple.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor instance, it is difficult to even get PHP functionality on a default thttpd installation.  However, for the purposes of simplicity and elegance, thttpd is likely the best starting point for a user to begin hosting hidden web sites.  The configuration file, thttpd.conf, is short and it is easy to understand the settings.

In other words, consider if one Tor hidden web site's hostname is xxxxxx.onion, and another is yyyyy.onion.  The contents of the /usr/local/www directory have two directories, xxxxx.onion/ and yyyyy.onion/ within which the data for each web site should reside.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nWhile thttpd is a simple and secure web server, it is difficult to hide the actual identity of thttpd itself.  If one selects a non-existent web page on a hidden web site, the page footer will convey that the server is running thttpd and its version.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nUsing nginx\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nUsing lighttpd\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWeb Site Data\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe web site data resides can reside in the normal location.

It should be inaccessible.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nSecond, watch the web server logs and see if the above test or other traffic is appearing in the log files.  Nothing should appear.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nNow, using the Tor Browser, type the hostname from tor/hidden_www in the address bar.  If web site data appears, the site is operational.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nOther tests for hidden web sites might include using a tool like nmap to scan the host for any open ports.  While services like sshd may be running, other services should be limited to the furthest extent possible.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nMore comprehensively, more advanced users might look at using Wireshark or tcpdump to watch network traffic.  Any traffic related to the hidden web site should be encrypted, and unviewable with these tools.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nWeb Site Statistics\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor most of the web hosting industry today, statistics on remote users is a vital part of their business.  Third party services such as Google Analytics are employed to get more nuanced pictures of the web site visitors.  Regardless of whether web site statistics are used for data mining purposes or for customizing and enhancing the user experience, statistics for hidden web sites reveal little other than the volume of traffic.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nMost web server logs show the IP address, the http request and the web browser the remote user employs.  However, hidden web sites are accepting traffic over the Tor network, and are not able to provide even the most basic information about a web site visitor.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis completely undercuts most simple web site analytics software such as Webalizer and \u003c\u003c???\u003e\u003e\u003e.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor hidden web sites, log files are not the basis of a nuanced, qualitative picture of web site visitors.  Rather, only the volume of visitors can be determined, in addition to the pages visited and the time of that visit.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003c\u003cLOG FILE example\u003e\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nBacking Up or Moving a Hidden Web Site\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFor public web servers running basic web sites, files like the web data directory, log files and web server configuration files are backed up.  For hidden web sites, those files should also be backed up.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nBut as important additions, the tor/hidden_www/hostname and tor/hidden_www/privatekey files should also be backed up, or used for migration to another host.  These files are unique to the hidden web server.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nRunning Additional Hidden Service on a Host\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nScaling to run more hidden web sites is simple.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nFirst, add the relevant additional lines in the torrc file, listening on a different local port and residing in another directory.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nTor2Web\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nNot every using who wants to visit a hidden web site has to use the Tor Browser.  In some cases, they might not be concerned with revealing their identities.  Ultimately, it is the user's decision as to whether or not their identity can be revealed in visiting a hidden web site.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nTor2web is the tool that bridges the public internet with Tor hidden web sites.  A hidden web site's address, normally appended with the .onion top-level domain, should be replaced with .tor2web.org or the additional addresses available.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nIt is critical to note that if using tor2web, the visitor's identity is not only revealed to tor2web, but the user also revels that they are visiting a Tor hidden web site.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nOther TCP Services Over Tor\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis piece focuses on running a web server on the Tor network, therefore it speaks of hidden \"web sites\" as opposed to hidden services in general.  However, other TCP-based services can also be run as hidden services, thereby masking the location of the services.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nMuch of this functionality is meant for more advanced technology users.  Other services might include chat with XMPP, mail retrieval and sending with IMAP/POP and SMTP, and for managing remote systems, SSHD.  Configuration is similar to setup of a hidden web site.  The service itself much first listen only on the localhost on a local port, and the torrc file needs to route requests to that locally listening service over the Tor network.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nDistributing the Hidden Service's Address\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nHidden web sites are not searchable with standard web search engines such as Google or Yahoo.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nOn the other hand, just because a hidden service is only reachable through a long, non-pronounceable address, it does not mean that web site itself is private.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nTherefore, some thought should be put into how to distribute the hidden service address.  And as an internet visitor requires either a functioning Tor client or tor2web, instructions on how to access the site is also important.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nSending a hidden service address over unencrypted email could easily reveal that the user might visit the site, and is a Tor user, which conveys that the user may have something to hide from an adversary.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nBeyond the Basics of Tor Hidden Services\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis is an introduction to running Tor hidden web sites.  All content is directed at configuring basic functionality.  However, hidden services are a developing technology, and interested users should read further about their operation.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThe standard Tor documentation for setting up a hidden service is located at:...  There is not a lot of detail on that page for most users, and this piece is meant to fulfill that need.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nAn important document to review is \"Tor: Hidden Service Protocol\" located at https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en.  This page explains in more detail the operation of a Tor hidden service.  It covers how a hidden service is advertised and how traffic routes to it, without services which are already part of the public internet infrastructure.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nReaders are encouraged to regularly follow the Tor blog for posts about hidden services in addition to the other topics.  One blog post in particular poses many of the core technical questions about hidden web services, along with the design weaknesses and future directions.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\nAn Unrestricted Internet: Where it is and Where It Could Go\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nBrowsing current hidden web sites today would likely disturb many regular public internet users.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nIt is an unrestricted realm where sites focused on pornography and drug distribution is common.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nIn many ways, however, the current state of the hidden internet is much like the early 1990's, when the graphical internet, or world-wide web, was young and unregulated.  The one notable difference is the lack of dry academic data that was common a few decades ago.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nHowever, this piece focused on utilizing the hidden internet as a tool.  It remains an underemployed method for dissidents, whistleblowers, free speech advocates and civil rights activists.  From one angle, it is the missing piece in the array of online tools that are used in contemporary struggles globally.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThis piece aimed to popularize the configuration of hidden web sites, and to provide moderately technical users some direction in entering the realm of Tor's darknet.  With the experience of running a hidden web site and other services, readers should look to follow future developments, and expand the utility for their own practical purposes.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n","pageTitle":"","responseHeaders":{"ACCEPT-RANGES":"bytes","CONTENT-LENGTH":"29194","CONTENT-TYPE":"text/html; charset=UTF-8","DATE":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 17:42:07 GMT","LAST-MODIFIED":"Wed, 21 Aug 2013 02:32:09 GMT","SERVER":"thttpd/2.26 14aug2014"},"bitcoinAddresses":null,"sshKey":"","ftpFingerprint":"","ftpBanner":"","smtpFingerprint":"","smtpBanner":""}
