# Two-Factor Authentication

If you choose to use 2FA with your Reddit account, enter your password followed by a colon and then your 2FA token in the `password` field on line 26. For example, if your password is "p4ssw0rd" and your 2FA token is "123456", you will enter "p4ssw0rd:123456" in the `password` field. 

**2FA is NOT recommended for use with this program.** This is because PRAW will raise an OAuthException after one hour, prompting you to refresh your 2FA token and re-enter your credentials. Additionally, this means your 2FA token would be stored alongside your Reddit username and password, which would defeat the purpose of enabling 2FA in the first place.
